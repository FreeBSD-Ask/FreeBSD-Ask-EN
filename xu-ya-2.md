# Re-preface: Back to copy paste, towards the curriculum itself

The book focuses on examples, less theories, as long as you move one step at a time on this example, and you will succeed, and you will have a sense of achievement and you will be able to keep on learning, because many people will give up when they encounter obstacles, and I am the kind of person who can hold on as long as he sees hope.

There are those who say in the Morals: “There is no way, there is no way, there is no way, there is no way.” There is no verse, and there may be different interpretations of this kind. But I'd like to use it to tell you that you have to try to find out what's behind each operation so that you can go back and forth, instead of learning to fit one desktop and then ask someone how to do another. This is why the curriculum does not provide orders that can be copied directly. To seek and gain, and thus to progress.

But the same “art and art” is repeated in Guo De Gwan's voice: “The art is fraud and the art is not a trader.” (The clearer video is [Deunesse's master food by his father and son in Shanghai in 2018] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpW_SRVEZEg), starting at 1:07:00) from the time of creation and from the time of publication, “The art is available, the art is available, the art is available, the art is not. These words are likely to be influenced by Guo De Ten。

The two preceding paragraphs reflect the difficulty of interpreting the cycle of interpretation: in order to understand locality, one must understand the whole; in order to understand the whole, one must understand locality. It's inevitable. We are always based on certain theoretical assumptions and individual opinions. But this is not necessarily negative, but rather indispensable. How would you explain to someone why the screen is broken, but the screen screen is still complete? Is that consistent with the human relationship

The vast majority of ancient Greek philosophers believe that the things that flow are not true. If everything changes, will the whole world be gone? Even the real world is a projection of the real world. And so I'm always looking for a world that's the same. Always looking for the same one. Kant believes that there should be an object of his own. All we can see is one side of things, the real face of things that we can never experience. Are things as real as we see them? Is it true that Cartesian's demonic hypothesis is only hypothetical

Hussel's semantics emphasize “back to the thing” (Zurück zu den Sachen selfst), not “back to Kant”. The principle of the principle of the study of all phenomena is intuitive. All traditional philosophies, opinions and visions are held up. To ask things in the context of what they are given, that is to say to be without preconditions. The things that come out are what they are. It's a matter of what you see, of what it is, of what it is, of what it is, of what it is, of what it is. Hussel undoubtedly took the Clarté et dissertation principle a step more thoroughly. His student, Heidegger, advocates “Looking at the thing” (Zu den Sachen Selbst), a rebel student, admitted that it is essential that we reveal the phenomenon。

“a man does not kiss his relatives or have a son, and brings old and old, and good, and young and able, and widowed and alone. confucius's famous thought was played out in the concertation. "the arts and craftsman needs to be cultured, the doctor needs to be medical, the swimmer needs to be swimming, and i've often seen the irony of this seemingly semantic repetition of "bullshit." in fact, getting things back is not easy in itself. “there are so many taboos in the world and so many people are poor; there are so many dolly tools and the country is dizziness; there are so many tricks and wonders; there are so many ordinances and thieves” (chap. 20 of the book), and we see so many “no garbage in the trash cans, no publicity on the streets and no people in bed”. at the same time, we note that in a large number of scientific and technical textbooks, both in china and abroad, there is always a proliferation of flaunts (by xxx availability, verbs) and defensive certificates (noting, apparently), and even the author himself will not do the subject of exercises printed in his book。

THE FACT IS, HOWEVER, THAT COMPUTER SCIENCE AS A SCIENCE IS EMPIRICAL. IF RESEARCH REALLY GOES BEYOND THE THEORY OF THE COMPUTER ITSELF, THE LEGITIMACY OF THE EXISTENCE OF COMPUTER SCIENCE WILL BE ELIMINATED — DOES THE WORLD REALLY EXIST? IS IT REALLY MEANINGFUL TO STUDY THIS? WHAT IF EVEN HAPPINESS DOES NOT EXIST? THE VAST MAJORITY OF US ARE NOT INVOLVED IN COMPUTER-RELATED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, NOR ARE THEY WORKING IN INTEL, AMD COMPANIES, AND IT'S HARDER TO GET A DOCTORATE. IS IT REALLY WRONG TO BE HAPPY TO COPY PASTE? HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN OUTSIDE THE CAVE? SOCRATES STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF VIRTUE AND REPEATEDLY STRESSED “KNOW YOU”, BUT SOCRATES WAS VOTED IN THE ATHENS REFERENDUM. IN FACT, MOST OF THE SO-CALLED THEORIES ARE JUST ANOTHER REPLICA OF PASTE. YOU CAN TRACE THE C LANGUAGE BACK TO COMPILATION, TO PROCESSOR INSTRUCTIONS, SIGNALS AND SYSTEMS, COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE, CPU DESIGN, PHYSICS, MATHEMATICS. AND? IS MATH REALLY OVER? SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS NEVER, NOR CAN THEY, STUDY THE ESSENCE, AND SCIENCE ONLY STUDIES PHENOMENA. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A “METHOD” IN SCIENCE, BUT A “METHOD”. IF YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THIS, IT IS NOTHING BUT A PHILOSOPHY OF MISERY. THIS IS ILLUSTRATED IN THE BOOK OF SOUTH CHINA — “I HAVE A CAREER AND NO CAREER. "CAN PEOPLE REALLY HAVE KNOWLEDGE INSTEAD OF OPINION?" SOCRATES IS AGAINST IT。

In fact, if you force the abstract words “the path” and “the art” from the old man, you will find that they are not in conflict with and difficult to separate. As you can see from the works of the late generations, those who saw The Swordman should not be unfamiliar with the words "The Unmeasured Spirit of the Too-Full": "Humanism, the rashness. Ghosts are fun, when life comes. Heaven is the best, ghost is the last. Fairy Dolls are good. Ghosts are bad. High up, bright and sad. If only it were done, it would not be human." There will be no return for mankind, and there will be no return for the fair. Is there a place where Sendao would go more than humanity? In the television show "Soldiers Strikes" (first of episode 3), Li Mon said, "Glory lies in peace and hardship in the long run." The word is not a simple denial of the word, but a further phase of the word. “Who can say and where the road goes? Who else can tell us where the day goes?” Enya's answer is “Only Time”. If people do not believe that maths is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is. Indeed, copy paste is available to everyone, and the question is, who did it? We need someone to copy the sticker: everyone wants to be a doctor, who cleans the garbage on the street and who cleans the streets? And the garbage always exists, and it always needs to be cleaned -- you can't just hide the trash cans on the street and lie to yourself that there's no garbage, and that just turns everything into a trash can. "The glass is clear, the orange is brilliant." Now the academic researcher, more than a thousand times more than Kandeh's own writings are written by Kant himself. But how many of them can be named in the history of philosophy? How many of these books have gone beyond Kant's own critical theory? They're just copying paste. Do you expect everyone to be like a dragon? Each is Plato, Aristotle, Kandeh, Hegel, Marx? Is that possible? And if you are not above them, you are no different from copy pasting. But are these really meaningless? I've seen too many rough-ass philosophies, and the human translation of the classics is wrong. No one can come forward and write a book that everyone can read. How many people said they were going to translate or create a book 20 years ago, and I still don't know what CIP and ISBN he was applying for. Is every human being a Buddha who can teach himself the path of understanding? Or is everyone a Wittgenstein and a philosopher without a philosophical history

The Koreans increasingly think of themselves as the rightful heirs of the Confucian family, and their whole life aims to revive Confucianism and put an end to old Buddha. The Maestro is no exception: the Koreans are using their ways as a means to train a taxi doctor who can promote Confucianism with a view to reviving Confucianism. So-called “where there is a way, there is a way”. But the real question is, is it possible? Is education possible? Is enlightenment and modernization possible? This has proved impossible. Many seem to be pursuing the so-called path, but the understanding of science is fundamentally wrong and does not want to break free of the shackles of caves. The truth is indeed the sun. The problem is that we are always in caves. People who think they are outside are still in another cave. Frankly, I don't know. “The knowledge, the knowledge, the knowledge.” I don't know, I don't want to know. I just need to be happy. It is clear from the "Teacher's words" that "you don't have to be a teacher, you don't have to be a teacher, you don't have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a teacher, you have to be a master, you have to be a master, you have to be a master, you have to be an expert in the arts, you have to be a professional, you are just a true." It seems to be a concrete example of the term “three by three, one by one”. But in fact, even though the Koreans have been critical of the law for the rest of their lives, these words are clearly influenced by Zheng's ideology, which is often discussed in the law: it is also a clear difference in the political education of religion and thought, and both pupils and masters are in the same position in the face of God and are learning together。

“Your eyes look straight ahead and your eyes look straight ahead. Make the way down your feet and hold on to everything. Do not turn your feet away from evil by turning your backs. “So do what they command you, but do not follow what they do, because they say and cannot do.” (Matha 23:3) “They will be recognized by their fruit. Can you pick grapes on a thorn? Can the figs be removed from the garb?” (Matha 7:16-17) “The teachings of the sacred habitat do nothing and do nothing.” I'm asking, isn't it happy if all members of the FreeBSD community are talking everyday

Unlike most operating systems, BSD provides both binary packages for rapid installation and source code for user-defined configuration. There are two kinds of ideas coming together. If someone's on hold, they're on hold — just like an article. It's hard to imagine how happy he is! In these times, happiness is extremely difficult to acquire. Look at this world. What's enough? He says it's not easy to buy a happy one. “All hope comes with an annotation, all faiths with a moaning.” Is the world really going to change? The “Question of Liang” is deeply troubling for generations of scholars. FreeBSD really gonna be okay? I'm deeply troubled。

In fact, no matter how you interpret the dowry or the old man, you will be touched by that negativity. Nor can the truth of the existence of the world hide her evils. Urbanization and industrialization have deprived generations of their homes. In fact, there is no complexity, and there is no benefit in an overly complex theory other than the loss of one ' s own people, as is clear from Chinese Buddhist history. "Don't think, don't do things you don't understand, don't do things you can't do": Returning to nature, to a simple society, is the motto of moral discourse. What we see, and that is what, even if there might be a greater presence behind him, you cannot deny what we see, and she does. In modern societies, almost everyone is re-emerging yesterday. Back to the copy paste is back to this simple three-point-one-point-and-two-point-one life。

It is a clear fact that the vast majority of people search the curriculum, looking for programmes that are not for what they seek the truth or for curiosity, but for a living. The truth you're looking for has long been overwritten by your eight pieces of Java and your endless algorithm on the platform. These are really interesting, meaningful, fun? I find it funny and ridiculous to say that. Now look up and look at the sky, and there are no stars except for the lamp of the towers and the mist and the pit beneath their feet. Guo De Gyeong said, "Just be funny. If it's not funny, it's funny!" Make a copy of the paste. If there's no one to make the paste, it's a blank
