BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL PROBLEMS AND NON-STANDARD REFERENCES TO LICENCES (MAINLY LACK OF AWARENESS), THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE THE AUTHOR WAS REQUIRED TO INDICATE THE SOURCE AND AUTHOR AS REQUIRED. I APOLOGIZE HERE. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE CONTACT ___CODESPAN_0_。

As part of the objectives of the project, we will rewrite all relevant parts as soon as possible or standardize the author and the project。
