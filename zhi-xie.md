# Acknowledgement

The initial structure of the book is based on the [early version] shared by the user, “Smile_Zheng”, “The Notes on Operating Systems” (https://tieba.baidu.com/p/7424071955). The main references are firewall chapters, users and privileges. [Reference is made to FreeBSD Technical Envisions (* [FreeBSD Unleashed] (https://www.amazon.com/FreeBSD-Unleashed-2nd-Brian-Tiemann/dp/0672324563)*), ISBN 9787111102010, Mechanical Industry Press, 2002, by Brian Tiemann, Michael Urban, Translator’s East Wisdom Studio] and the non-impressive blog article (already).

Sorry

Because of historical problems and non-standard references to licences (mainly lack of awareness), there have been instances where the author was required to indicate the source and author as required. I apologize here. If you have any questions, contact `yklaxds@gmail.com ' .

As part of the objectives of the project, we will rewrite all relevant parts as soon as possible or standardize the author and the project.

# Project deployment and maintenance

The early sponsors of the FreeBSD project are [clean-master master clean-up masters] (https://github.com/clean-master). He created the domain name `freebsdcn.org` (no longer in use) at his own expense and the home page <https://bsdcn.org>, which is still in use. He encouraged ykla to create a project to maintain the FreeBSD curriculum.

[Roberta Wheeler] (https://github.com/rowheel) has been self-funded to maintain servers used for the FreeBSD project (currently to the free GitBook and GitHub Pages) and has written some articles.

[safreya] (https://github.com/safreya) has written 2 sections for the export of an open source tool for this PDF project (currently in use) and has written a large number of articles.

The pre-Ubuntu bar owner, Simple, has proposed changes to the chapter title of the project and to the licence agreement, which enhances the viability of the project.
