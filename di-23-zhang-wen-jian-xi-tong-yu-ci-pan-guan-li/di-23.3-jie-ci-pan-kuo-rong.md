About UFS

UFS is fully known as UNIX File System, a UNIX file system based on UNIX v7. In the past, MacOS used the file system as a root file system. FreeBSD is currently using UFS2. Linux's reading and writing support for UFS is also incomplete. This file system can only be expanded and cannot be reduced.

> ** Note**
>
The UFS storage used in devices such as > UFS file systems and mobile phones is not the same, and the UFS is an abbreviation of the Universal Flash Store, which is already available at 4.0 (FreeBSD supports eMC in 10.4; the UFS appears in FreeBSD 15.0 development plan and is not yet supported). The UFS version number as a file system is only 2. Also, the system inside the cell phone is not likely to be a UFS file system, because Anzor, based on Linux, does not support UFS at all, and the general root file system for these devices is ext.4 (some new devices are F2FS).
