```sh '
# cd /usr/ports/devel/qtcreator/ & make install clean
#cd /usr/ports/misc/qt5-l10n/ & make install plain
````

Or (Qt Creator does not recommend binary packages)

```sh '
# pkg install qtcreator qt5-110n
````

# Qt Creator

See [Bug 236518 - devel/qtcreator unsuppleted other languages] (https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=236518)

The Qt Creator interface language default follow-up system. If not, change manually in the menu `Edit ' - > `Preferences ' - `Environment ' - > `Interface ' - > `Language ' .

Compiler debuggers can be configured without configuration.

The program Qt Creator wrote may not be available in Chinese. The problem is that Qt supports the input method in a plugin way.

```sh '
$ls /usr/local/lib/qt5/plugins/platforminputtexts
````

See the following output:

```sh '
I don't know, libfcitx5platforminputcontextplugin.so
I'm not sure if I'm going to do this.
````

For ibus and fcitx. The inability to enter Chinese is due to the possible incompatibility of the library version on which the two documents rely. To solve these problems, qtcreator needs to be installed through ports compilation instead of pkg.
