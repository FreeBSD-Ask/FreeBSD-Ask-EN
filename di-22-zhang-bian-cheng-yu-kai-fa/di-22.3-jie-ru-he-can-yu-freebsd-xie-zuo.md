# Section 22.3 How to participate in FreeBSD development

Translating the documents, submitting the port is a good way to do it.

First of all, we need to read: <https://wiki.freebsd.org/Phabricat>

It's very clear. You need to register an account... the connection is also possible. But your username will get weirder, which means...

The simple solution to the problem with the code is to use the original github fork code as the main branch main, unchanged, and create a new branch B to develop modifications and so on.

This way, when the modification or development is completed, syncs the main branch B to the latest status (just press an updated button on the web page) and executes the command under branch B:

```sh '
# Under any branch
Let checkout B
$get diff -U999999 origin/main > 2023-1-24.diff # Under Branch B
````


- Example:

```sh '
Root@generic: ~ ~ #get clean https://github.com/ykla/freebsd-ports #clonedfreebsd-ports to local

This way the .diff file generated under the root directory of Branch B can be uploaded to the [link] above (https://reviews.freebsd.org/differential/) (slight, look carefully at the top right corner), click on the top right corner and fill in the relevant information for review.

That's the simplest way I think. What needs to be noted is not to change too much...

Upon submission, a new <https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla> will be added to indicate where to change, with links to <https://reviews.freebsd.org> and, upon completion, return to <https://reviews.freebsd.org> with links to the previous bug page. If you don't do this, it'll be a long time before you're seen.

diff is not considered to be a modification of the resulting document, nor is the last diff file left in advance of the next diff.

The above applies to FreeBSD doc src and ports, and a few of them are on github, such as quarterly reports.

> Unlike closed Linux kernel development, anyone can participate in modifying the source code for FreeBSD. The Linux kernel development is a list of mails that need to be sent to the Linux kernel as a result of the execution of a script.

Some possible commands:

- Setup agent:

```sh '
US$ gint config --global http.proxy http://192.168.1.169:7890
````

- Check all branches.

```sh '
It's a good idea.

- Switch to A Branch

```sh '
It's a good idea.
