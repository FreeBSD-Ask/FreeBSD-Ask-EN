# Section 22.2 How to develop a Port

Proposed reading of FreeBSD Port Developer Manual

FreeBSD software is available in port, and developers do not need to consider how to package into binary packages, and the port does not contain the source code of the software, similar to Gentoo (Gentoo's portage is removed from ports), so the theoretical transplantation is not very difficult。

when you have completed the transplant, you can submit a bug to the bug reporting system to request a merger (or send it directly to [https://reviews.freebsd.org/] (https://reviews.freebsd.org/) and the specific format can be found in the list. if this is not the case for a long time, please send an e-mail to the mailing list and ask if anyone can help with the submission. if there's no one else, please send it back another week。
