On install:

By default, zsh looks for system-wide solutions in
/usr/local/etc.

If you definitely set up/etc/zprofile,/etc/zshenv, etc.,
I don't know, either move them to/usr/local/etc or build zsh with the
ETCDIR option available.

== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
root@ykla:/home/ykla
By default, zsh will find default settings for system ranges in /usr/local/etc.

If you set up /etc/zprofile, /etc/zshenv, etc.,
Either move them to /usr/local/etc or rebuild the zsh with the ETCDIR option enabled.

# Configure csh/ tcsh

csh (C Shell, inspired by C language and similar language, by Bill Joy) is the shell in the FreeBSD Basic System,** the default shell used by root users**.

>csh relation to tsch
>
> It is necessary to note that csh in FreeBSD is tcsh. There is no difference between the two. You can see from the source code <https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/blame/main/bin/csh/Makefile>, while man csh is redirected to tcsh.


Note**
>
> While csh tsch is essentially a program, there is a clear difference between the two when used and the tcsh extension is closed if the csh parameter is used.


> ** Note**
>
Shell in [FreeBSD 14] is unified for sh (https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src/committee/d410b585b6f00a26c2d7724d6576a3ea7d548b7).

I don't...

- How to show different colours in file folders:

Insert ~/.csh.cshrc ' :

```sh '
I don't know.
````

And re-entry is fine.

I don't...

- How can FreeBSD csh list unfillable candidates by tab like a bash? In ~/.csh.cshrc ' , insert:

```sh '
Here you go.
Here you go.
````

Refresh environment variables:

```sh '
~ .cshrc
````

- How do you make csh with a command error like zsh?

For example, you write c-language programs with emacs, but when you lose `emacs ma ' press the `Tab ' return: he will match all files starting with `ma ' . This configuration ignores part of the matching file, i.e., nothing will be ignored when you press `Tab ' . Programming friendly, no more matching to binary `.o ' or something:

```sh '
What's your name?
Set fignore = (.o ~) emacs ma [d]main.c main.c ~ maain.o emacs ma [tab] emacs main.c
````
