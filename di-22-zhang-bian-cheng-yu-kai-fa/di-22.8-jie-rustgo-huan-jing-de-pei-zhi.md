## APPENDIX: INSTALLATION __CODESPAN_0_

rustup-init is used to install/initiate rustup as a common/non root user。

Rustup installs Rust programming languages from official distribution channels, enabling it to pull out different versions of rust, bypassing Port lang/ rust and __CODESPAN_0_. It's kind of like my world starter, going in and down to my world versions。

- install with pkg:

```sh
# pkg install rustup-init
```

- Install with Ports:

```sh
# cd /usr/ports/devel/rustup-init/ 
# make install clean
```
