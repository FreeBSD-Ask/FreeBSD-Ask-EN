# Section 22.10 Debug FreeBSD by IDA 7

Note**
>
>Windows, IDA, FreeBSD all require 64 bits, otherwise they may not be used properly。

__CODESPAN_0_file in dbgsrv folder first found in the installation path of IDA in Windows。

Copy it to **FreeBSD**, which can be operated with Winscp。

Copy __CODESPAN_0_ and your file taget(supposed) that you need to debug remotely to __CODESPAN_1_ folder (a folder of any kind), give permission to __CODESPAN_2_ and run `linux_server64`_。

And run, reference red box。

The first is the location of the debugging document in the virtual machine。

The second is the path of debugging a file in a virtual machine。

here, target is the specific debugging file。

the third is the parameter that is to be passed to the main function, which is not usually written。

Then the host ip address of the FreeBSD system, the port number and password for listening (i.e. SSH password, this is root user because __CODESPAN_0_files are running under root user)。

See your ip address at FreeBSD system terminal __CODESPAN_0_

The successful results were as follows:
