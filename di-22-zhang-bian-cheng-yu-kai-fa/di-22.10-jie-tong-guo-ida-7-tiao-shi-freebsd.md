# Section 22.10 Debug FreeBSD by IDA 7

Note**
>
>Windows, IDA, FreeBSD all require 64 bits, otherwise they may not be used properly.

The `linux_server64 ' file in the dbgsrv folder was first found in the installation path of IDA in the Windows system.

Copy it to **FreeBSD**, which can be operated with Winscp.

Copy `linux_server64 ' and your file needing remote debugging target (assuming) to the `/root/reverse ' folder (the folder is arbitrary), giving permission to `777 ' and running `linux_server64 ' .

And run, reference red box.

Please use **64 bit IDA,** as shown below.

The first is the location of the debugging document in the virtual machine.

The second is the path of debugging a file in a virtual machine.

Here, target is the specific debugging file.

The third is the parameter that is to be passed to the Main function, which is not usually written.

Next is the ip address of the host ip of the FreeBSD system, the port number and password for listening to it (i.e. the SSH password, this is the root user because `linux_server64 ' files are running under the root user).

`ifconfig-a ' at FreeBSD system terminal can view its ip address

The successful results were as follows:
