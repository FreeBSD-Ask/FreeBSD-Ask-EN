Section 22.13 Node.js

# Update basic systems

The binary Node.js installed by pkg relies on `/lib/librypto.so.xx ', a specific version, which means that if you need to use Node.js on FreeBSD, you have to look at the version of FreeBSD itself, especially when your pkg configuration uses the last source.

If you want Node.js to be installed on FreeBSD, please update the basic system and install it.

# Yarn + Node.js

```sh '
# Freebsd-update setch install #
# pkg install yarn # will automatically install the corresponding version of nodejs
````

or

````
#cd /usr/ports/www/yarn/
# Make install clean #
````

# NPM + Node.js

```sh '
# pkg install npm
````

or

````
#cd/usr/ports/www/npm/
# Make install clean #
````

FreeBSD NPM Replace source

```sh '
#npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
````

That's the original scavenging mirror station. See <https://npmmirror.com>.

# Fragmentation and unfinished business

- If you skip the upgrade of the FreeBSD basic system (`freebsd-update setch install ' ) and install the software directly, you may encounter the following errors on FreeBSD:

```sh '
# Pkg install yarn
%ode
ld-elf.so.l: /lib/libcrypto.so.111: version OPENSSL_1_1_1_1_1_ by/usr/local/bin/node not found
````
