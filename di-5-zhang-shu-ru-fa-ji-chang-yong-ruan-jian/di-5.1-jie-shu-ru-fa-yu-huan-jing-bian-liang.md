# Localized associated variables

THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES ARE USED TO LOCALIZE THE CONTROL ENVIRONMENT, MOST OF WHICH ARE DEFINED BY POSIX。

__CODESPAN_0_ SERIES VARIABLES ARE __CODESPAN_1_ ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES USED IN LOCALIZATION (I.E., INTERNATIONALIZATION AND LOCALIZATION) IN THE OPERATING SYSTEM. THESE VARIABLES CONTROL THE TEXT CHARACTER ENCODING, DATE AND TIME FORMAT, CURRENCY SYMBOLS, LANGUAGE, ETC. SOME OF THE COMMON VARIABLES ARE:

- __CODESPAN_0_: DEFINES THE RULES FOR STRING SORTING。
- __CODESPAN_0_: DEFINES CHARACTER SETS AND CHARACTER TYPE JUDGEMENT RULES, SUCH AS LETTERS, NUMBERS, POINTS, ETC。
__CODESPAN_0_: DEFINES CURRENCY FORMATS AND CURRENCY SYMBOLS。
- __CODESPAN_0_: DEFINES THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE INFORMATION IS EXPORTED WHILE THE APPLICATION IS RUNNING。
- __CODESPAN_0_: DEFINE NUMERICAL FORMATS SUCH AS DECIMAL POINTS AND THOUSANDS SEPARATOR。
-_CODESPAN_0_: DEFINE DATE AND TIME FORMAT。
__CODESPAN_0_: DEFINES THE FORMAT OF THE ADDRESS。
__CODESPAN_0_: FORMAT FOR DEFINING A PERSON ' S NAME。
- __CODESPAN_0_: DEFINE PAPER SIZE AND PRINT FORMAT。
__CODESPAN_0_: DEFINES THE FORMAT OF THE TELEPHONE NUMBER。
__CODESPAN_0_: DEFINES THE FORMAT OF THE MEASUREMENT UNIT。
- ___ CODESPAN_0_: FORMATS DEFINING DOCUMENT CHARACTERISTICS。

Special:

-_CODESPAN_0: BY SETTING THIS VARIABLE, THE VALUE OF ALL OTHER __CODESPAN_1_ VARIABLES CAN BE COVERED AT THE SAME TIME。
- __CODESPAN_0_: TO SET THE DEFAULT LANGUAGE AND CHARACTER SET. IT IS USUALLY USED TO PROVIDE AREA SETTINGS WHEN NO OTHER __CODESPAN_1_ VARIABLE SETTINGS ARE AVAILABLE. IF __CODESPAN_2 __ AND __CODESPAN_3 __ VARIABLE: __CODESPAN_4 __ VARIABLE WILL OVERRIDE THE CORRESPONDING SETTINGS IN __CODESPAN_5 __ VARIABLE。
__CODESPAN_0: THE LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT USED TO SET THE CURRENT SYSTEM AFFECTS THE BEHAVIOUR OF MANY PROGRAMS, SUCH AS DATE FORMAT, DIGITAL FORMAT, CHARACTER ENCODING, ETC. SPECIFICALLY, THIS ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE IS USUALLY AUTOMATICALLY READ BY SOME PROGRAMS AND, DEPENDING ON ITS VALUE, DETERMINES WHICH LANGUAGE AND LOCALIZATION SETTINGS SHOULD BE USED. IF THIS VARIABLE IS NOT SET, THE PROGRAM MAY USE THE DEFAULT SYSTEM LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT OR OTHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (E.G. __CODESPAN_1 , __CODESPAN_2 ) TO DETERMINE THE LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT。

By using these variables, users can easily adapt the language and localization settings of the operating system to different geographic and linguistic environments。

- THE CURRENT VALUES OF THE ABOVE VARIABLES CAN BE DETERMINED USING __CODESPAN_0_ COMMANDS SUCH AS:

```sh
$ locale
LANG=C.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="C.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="C.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="C.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="C.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="C.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="C.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
```

- So Chinese culture can be different。

Cultures in a simple interface simply set up __CODESPAN_0 to __CODESPAN_1 (validated under SDDM/Xfce)。
THE MORE COMMON ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES __CODESPAN_0, __CODESPAN_1 AND __CODESPAN_2 ARE SET TO __CODESPAN_3_。
3. English-only environment, with Chinese input。

---|---

WHY SET __CODESPAN_0, __CODESPAN_1 AND __CODESPAN_2 TO __CODESPAN_3? IT IS MAINLY THE DEVELOPERS WHO USE DIFFERENT VARIABLES WHEN WRITING THE PROGRAM, FOR GREATER COMPATIBILITY。

---|---

The first set-up only affects interfaces, tips, etc., but has no impact on other format outputs (reference __CODESPAN_0_ set of variables) e.g. (sh)。

```sh
$ locale
LANG=C.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="C.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="C.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="C.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="C.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="C.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES=zh_CN.UTF-8
LC_ALL=
$ date
Fri Apr 21 21:14:43 UTC 2023
$ export LC_TIME=zh_CN.UTF-8
$ date
2023年 4月21日 星期五 21时15分07秒 UTC
```

By default:

- __CODESPAN_0_ ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE __CODESPAN_1_
- __CODESPAN_0_ COMMAND OUTPUT_CODESPAN_1___
- __CODESPAN_0_ SET THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE TO __CODESPAN_1_
- __CODESPAN_0_ COMMAND OUTPUT `2023年 4月21日 星期五 21时15分07秒 UTC`_。

Note**
>
THE ENGLISH-LANGUAGE OUTPUT OF THE >MAINTENANCE OF __CODESPAN_0_ COMMANDS IS SOMETIMES IMPORTANT FOR SOME SCRIPTS (THIS IS ONLY ONE CASE AND OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS, ETC.). THIS IS ALSO THE CASE WITH OTHER INFORMATION CONTROLLED BY __CODESPAN_1_。
