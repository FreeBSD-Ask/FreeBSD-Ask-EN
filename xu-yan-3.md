# Three editions of the preamble: with a sense of the dream (draft)

The first dream:

I'm the one who opened the Excel question collection (CFC question collection), and I find that there's still no one to write, and there's only four to five lines of my own. Well, I found another line, but it was quickly deleted. I found that there were two extra columns in the front of the table: a request for a real name and something like a political face. I thought I was wrong, maybe I used the wrong template, and I told the group masters that I'd send it to you manually, and then you collect the questions.

Then I went north of the village, where the old village had not been demolished. I found a family, there was a yellow square like a doorbell in front of the door. I just wanted to go inside and I found the dog barking.

I next dreamt that FreeBSD was on the east side of the village where I lived, but I was there a few days ago, and it was all empty, nothing but dirt and garbage.

Then I went to the west of the village, and it was supposed to be empty, but there were a lot of girls in red or brown skirts who looked like they were talking on their bicycles.

In my dream, I received a letter from Shandong in 2015 and over $16,000. The envelope contains both a private number and my real number. The last letter on my address is 302. Letter from FreeBSD China's last maintainer. He said the largest contribution received was only $10. There's a shipping log in the letter, and the last page says it was sent to me, and he spent $302. He said he couldn't keep it. He wanted me to keep it. There is also a book that introduces UNIX.

The letter was still open, and I was woken up by two phone calls that were basically nothing.

Wake up, I opened Excel's collection table and looked at it, and it was just the line I wrote. There's only one call in the log.

2015 was my first contact with FreeBSD. FreeBSD had bugs, a start-up disk under UEFI, a HD 4000 graphic card, and I was never able to access the installation. As a result, three or four years were put on hold. It's been 10 years.

I don't...

The second dream:

I dreamt I graduated from a college. As if I had participated in some kind of security contest before, I also defeated the enemy by sneaking, and eventually won a second place with a medal.

After graduation, I packed my stuff from the classroom to go out to the wild. I'm riding out the South Gate of the school. On the way I saw a very good schoolboy running, and I followed him to a place like a water park. The current wasn't fast, but I soon couldn't see him, so I decided to ride back.

On the way back, I met a lady who was roasting a cat. The cat appeared to have sustained injuries to the head and front paws, and was wrapped in tin paper, wondering whether she was treating the cat or wanting to eat the cat. She's stuck in the exit, and I'm in a hurry to get out of there. It wasn't just me, but a group of people came out with me.

There seemed to be a fair in the middle, and I kept walking back and forth from a bunch of clothes that were selling.

When I got out, I came to the South Gate of the school, and I heard I was not allowed in. Some say it's possible to get in from the Washington Hospital Institute to the west. But I've just come half way, and I've heard it's harder to get in from the Institute. But I was told that some schools had been moved to this place from the west, and that there was nothing I could do to manage the school. But when I got to the Institute, everyone went to the Institute on the street bridge and looked for any documents, and I had to go back to the school's main door.

I found a place to park my bike, so I found myself without shoes. I pulled my shoes out of my pocket. The school was surrounded by many people, all of whom were stopped at night, and one of the leaders, a classmate who tried to sneak in before the fight. I waited a long time to see that the school door was closing, and then I went down and whispered to the leader that I was graduating today, and there was something going on. The leader said, "You can't do anything about it. Go inside." And I said to the doorman, "Then let me out later." The doorman was afraid of taking responsibility, and I said, "Something happened to the leader." I think I'm gonna go back to my dorm or someone else. This is the end of the dream.

I don't...
