# Section 21.2 RockyLinux Compatibility (FreeBSD Port)

As of 2024.9.19, Port/package [emulators/linux-rl9] (https://www.freshports.org/emulators/linux-rl9/) based on RockyLinux 9.5 (published on 19 November 2024):

```sh '
bash-$5.1 cat/etc/redhat-release
Rocky Linux please 9.5 (Brue Onix)
````

# Load Linux module

```sh '
♪ Service Linux enough
# Service Linux start
````

# Install basic systems

- Install with pkg:

```sh '
# pkg install linux-rl9
````

- Or install with Ports:

```sh '
#cd /usr/ports/emulators/linux-rl99
# Make install clean
````

# Configure Services

```sh '
# General desktops are configured
# service dbus start
#dbus-uuidgen > /compat/linux/etc/machine-id

There is no need to configure `fstab ' , 'linux_mounts_enable ' will run automatically.

Effective after restart.
