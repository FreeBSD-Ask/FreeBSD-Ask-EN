Section 2.1 Preparation for installation (new introductory version)

# FreeBSD version introduction

FreeBSD is known to have the following versions (or stages): alpha, rc, beta, release, current, stable。

**release** version can be used on a day-to-day/server basis, i.e. in a general sense **stabilized** or LTS. ***stable*** and ***current*** are both ** development branches** and are **stable** (Stabilization and instability are relative to all nondes **current** (https://freebsdfoundation.org/netflix-case-study/))。

Note**
>
>FreeBSD ***stable*** is not consistent with the general Linux issue concept of a “stabilized version” but rather a “developmental version” ** of instability**。
>
The true meaning of >FreeBSD is that the ABI of the branch (Application Binary Interface, Application Binary Interface) is stable。
>
> - See [FreeBSD Grossary STABLE] (https://wiki.freebsd.org/Glossary#STABLE)

alpha is the first step for a current into release. the specific process is current -- > alpha -- > beta -- > rc -- > release。

when the curent is relatively stable (i.e. MFC for a minimum of three days, MFC, i.e. __CODESPAN_0, similar to __CODESPAN_1_) will be pushed back to stable, but there is no guarantee that the two are not big bugs. See [FreeBSD Release Engineering] (https://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/freebsd-relang/)。

Note**
>
>Only alpha, rc, beta and releasing (https://www.freebsd.org/platforms/) can be used to update the __CODESPAN_0_ system, the rest of which will need to be updated by source code compilation (or by pkgbase)。
>
>FreeBSD development plan to delete command __CODESPAN_0_, all to pkgbase。

# Download FreeBSD mirror

First of all, we'll open FreeBSD project officer network: <https://www.freebsd.org/>:

WE CLICK ON THE YELLOW BOTTOM RED, CODESPAN_0, AND WE JUMP AS FOLLOWS:

Note**

> WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IT, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE 14.2. YOU JUST HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OF THE TOP OF THE CODESPAN_0. __CODESPAN_1 IS A VALUE GREATER THAN __CODESPAN_2_。

Windows 10 and 11 carry their own command line tool, CODESPAN_0, without additional software.

# Burn FreeBSD mirror

>** Skills**
>
>FreeBSD 14.1 RELEASE both ISOs are tested under Ventoy (UEFI under Intel 3D processor). However, the possibility of problems not being ruled out. If you have a problem, consider downloading __CODESPAN_0_ for normal writing。


>** Skills**
>
>U disk installation is best with __CODESPAN_0 or `-img.xz`_. Because `.iso` mirrors did not do Hybrid mix start, writing to the U-disk creates errors. See [Free BSD-.iso files not support write to USB drive] (https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi?id=236786)。
>
>
>THE MIRROR AT THE END OF __CODESPAN_0_ SHOULD BE SELECTED ONLY IF **CD/VVM** IS INSTALLED。
>
> BUT NOTHING IS ABSOLUTE, SOME MACHINES USE __CODESPAN_0_ TO WRITE THE U-DISK STARTER AND STILL HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THE INSTALLATION INTERFACE. SOME OF THE MACHINES (E.G. THE OLD CANOE COMPUTER) SUPPORT UEFI UNDER ISO. BUT NOT ALL MACHINES (E.G. NOT SUPPORTED BY RICE)。

- How do I write FreeBSD mirrors to the U.D.

The writing tool on Windows should be preferred **Rufus**, Linux uses __CODESPAN_0_ commands. rufus download address: [https://rufus.ie/zh] (https://rufus.ie/zh)

> ** Warning**
>
> ** Not recommended** Use the win32dinskimiger recommended in the FreeBSD manual, sometimes with errors in authentication (in fact, the document verification is normal). ** Should only be used if rufus is invalid. ** Win32diskimager download address <https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/archive/>, can be downloaded by clicking __CODESPAN_0_。


>** Skills**
>
>rufus does not need to be decompressed and select __CODESPAN_0_ to start the disk-making process。
