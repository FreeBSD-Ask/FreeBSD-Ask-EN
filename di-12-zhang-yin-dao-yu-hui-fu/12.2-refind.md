# Section 12.2 Configure rEFInd

It's a real problem to switch back and forth at the BIOS, and we can use [rEFInd] (https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/) to achieve a Clover-like effect by choosing the operating system we want to access when you turn it on.

`rEFInd ' inscribed from `rEFIT ' from the combination of the terms “refind” (improvement, perfection) and “EFI” (Extensible Firmware Interface, extended solidware interface), i.e., modification of UEFI.

Opens the download page [Getting rEFInd from SourceForge] (https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html), and click on `A binary zip file ' to jump to download automatically. This writing is used in `refind-bin-0.14.2.zip ' .

Only part of the document is a useful start-up document. We just need one of the `refind ' folders, the others are not.

Only part of the `refind ' folder is a useful start-up document. All those with the words `aa64 ' and `ia32 ' may be deleted.

All the documents used are shown in the figure below.

We copy `refind.conf-sample ' and rename it `refind.conf ' .

Use [disskgenius] (https://www.disskgenius.com/) to copy the `refind ' folder into the efi folder under the EFI file system.

Both options are available.

# Appendix: rEFIND Theme

There are several themes available for rEFIND.

This example is illustrated by the use of Matrix-rEFInd.

Project address: [Matrix-rEFInd] (https://github.com/Yannis444/Matrix-rEFInd/)

Download the project to compress `Matrix-rEFInd-master.zip ' . Rename the unpressed folder `Matrix-rEFInd-master ' as `Matrix-rEFInd'.

New directory `themes ' , place `Matrix-rEFInd ' in `themes ' .

Copy `themes ' to the `refind ' folder in the efi folder in the EFI partition.

Edit `refind.conf ' (can not copy directly to the desktop, edit and then overwhelm) and add `include them/Matrix-rEFInd/theme.conf ' to the last line of this document.

Restart:
