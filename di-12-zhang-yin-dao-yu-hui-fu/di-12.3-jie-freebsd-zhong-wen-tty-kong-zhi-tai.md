# Section 12.3 FreeBSD Chinese TTY Console

FreeBSD's new terminal VT, which supports CJK, so you can show Chinese by putting it in font。

This post is based on FreeBSD 14.2 RELEASE。

FONT FORMAT `.fnt` (NOT A TABLE + PNG PICTURE, BUT A BINARY FONT FILE), COMMAND:

```sh
$ vidcontrol -f test.fnt
```

FreeBSD Basic System provides a tool to convert bdf, hex to fnt:

```sh
$ vtfontcvt [ -h 高度 ] [ -v ] [ -w 宽度] [字体路径]
```

- Example:


[tty without font] (. . .getbook/assets/tty0.png)

```sh
$ fetch https://people.freebsd.org/~emaste/newcons/b16.fnt
$ vidcontrol -f b16.fnt
```

[tty after settings are finished]

THE ORDERS ARE PROVISIONAL AND, IN ORDER TO TAKE EFFECT PERMANENTLY, THEY WILL BE ADDED TO ___CODESPAN_0_:

```sh
allscreens_flags="-f /root/b16.fnt"
```

# Fragmentation and unfinished business

- Don't know how to generate Chinese fonts manually. <https://github.com/usonianhorizon/vt-fnt> does not understand the method and can generate bdf files, but the error is the same as the other text. The software mentioned in it, FontForge, has Windows version, downloading path at <https://fontforge.org/en-US/downloads/windows-dl/>。
