# Section 12.3 FreeBSD Chinese TTY Console

FreeBSD's new terminal VT, which supports CJK, so you can show Chinese by putting it in font.

This post is based on FreeBSD 14.2 RELEASE.

Font format `.fnt ' (not a table + PNG picture, but a binary font file) command:

```sh '
That's right.
````

FreeBSD Basic System provides a tool to convert bdf, hex to fnt:

```sh '
$ vtfontcvt [-h height] [-v] [-w width] [ font path]
````

- Example:


! [tty without fonts] (. .gitbook/assets/tty0.png)

```sh '
$ fix https://people.freebsd.org/~emaste/newcons/b16.fnt
That's right.
````

! [tty after setting finished] (. .gitbook/assets/tty1.png)

The orders are provisional and, for their permanent validity, add `/etc/rc.conf ' :

```sh '
Allcreens_flags= "-f/root/b16.ft"
````

# Fragmentation and unfinished business

- Don't know how to generate Chinese fonts manually. <https://github.com/usonianhorizon/vt-fnt> does not understand the method and can generate bdf files, but the error is the same as the other text. The software mentioned in it, FontForge, has Windows version, downloading path at <https://fontforge.org/en-US/downloads/windows-dl/>.
