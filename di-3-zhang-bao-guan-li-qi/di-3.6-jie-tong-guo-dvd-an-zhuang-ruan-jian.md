Section 3.6 Installing software via DVD

# Mount DVD to `/dist ' directory

- Directly mount local ISO:

```sh '
# mdconfig / home/ykla/FreeBSD-14.2-RELEASE-amd64-dvd1.iso #
md0
# mkdir-p/dist
# Mount-t cd9660 /dev/md0 /dist # cannot directly mount ISO, wrongly report
````

- Direct use of DVD devices (e.g. ISO mirrors mounted directly through virtual machines):

Watch ISO mount:

```sh '
# Gpart show

...leave the useless disk...

=>9 2356635 cd0 MBR (4.5G)
9 2356635 - free - (4.5G)
````

A `cd0 ' can be seen, and the size matches.

```sh '
# mkdir -p /dist # create mount point
# Mount-t cd9660/dev/cd0/dist # Mount ISO
#ls /list/ # check for mount
..cshrc bin lib net root var
I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to do that.
.rr_moved dev media proc tmp
I don't know what you're talking about.

# # troubleshooting and unfinished business

**/dist** If the directory is changed to another, the environment variable method is not valid because `packages/repos/FreeBSD_install_cdrom.conf ' cannot be modified.

# Install DVD software using 'bsdconfig ' (currently invalid)

Let's start with the way above.

```sh '
# bsdconfig
