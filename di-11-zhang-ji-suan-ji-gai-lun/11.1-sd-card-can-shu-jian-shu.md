# Section 11.1 Description and testing of storage card parameters

#microSD card (storage card/TF card/SD card/RAM card) parameter description


Storage card specifications were developed by the [SD Society] (https://www.sdcard.org/).

The SD card standards are confusing, and even compared to the USB standards set by the USB-IF Association, the degree of confusion is difficult to explain.

The reason for the confusion in the SD card standard is that, while developing at any time, the SD card association does not discard the old standard (e.g., abandoning the British unit, using the public unit), let alone raise the previous standard (e.g., swipe number), but rather creates a higher standard. ** In short, SD cards have multiple parallel measures and overlaps and differences in the range. **

The figure above is a microSD (micro) SD card, used by a treeberry pie, mobile phone.

Note**
>
>Standard SD card is used only for the oldest treeberry pie, and the current standard SD card "Big Card" is used mainly for cameras.

MicroSD is what we call TF cards.


This flashy microSD card is marked:

- `Sandisk Ultra ' : `Sandisk ' is the English language of the brand name "Bringy"; `Ultra ' is the Moody ' s own model - the superhighway.
- `128 GB ' : Storage card capacity is 128 GB.
- `C10 ' (`10 ' around a circular “C” symbol): this parameter is invalid and need not be seen. Now all the cards are 10, and it's hard to find less than 10.
- ' Mirco SD XC ' (micro SDXC): means that the card capacity is between 32 G-2TB; 2G-32G is "micro SDHC". Others are now largely invisible - capacity less than 2G (microSD) or capacity greater than 2TB (microSDUC). It doesn't make any sense, because it has to be a card with a capacity size.
- `U1 ' (`1 ' around a circular `U' symbol): `U1 ' has a minimum writing speed of 10MB/s; `U3 ' is 30MB/s. ** No U2**. ** Only old products (U3) or low-speed devices (U1) will be marked**
- `1 ' (XC right, below U1): UHS-I: bus maximum 104MB/s; UHS-II 312MB/s. The bus determines the speed limit of the memory card.
- `A1 ' : Random reading and writing rate. There's only A1 and A2 at the moment, and without it, there's no A1. Berry pie must use an A2 card.


# Supplement

- `667x ' , `1066x ' : cards such as Rexa will be marked 667x, or 1066x, which currently only has CD machines, tape machines, CDs and CDs in service, which are quite old (in the 1980s).

1667x = 150KB/s x 667 ≈ 83MB/S;

21066x = 150KB/s x 1066 ≈ 156MB/S.

- `V30 ' : New products are generally marked `U3 ' as **V30**. No V60, but it's very expensive (normal A2 card 1 dollar 1G; V60 3 dollar 1G, but it seems that V60 A2 doesn't co-exist) V90 microSD card I haven't seen. Also not seen under V30, generally marked `U1 ' . Rate standard conversion: ***C10 = U1 = V10*** These three things are one thing, but they are marked.


Summarizing: This flash microSD memory card is marked with seven parameters, four of which are useless. And in terms of parameters, this memory card does not have any advantage and is quite common.

# Storage card selection summary

Summary: For berry pie: capacity (recommended at least 32G), continuous reading and writing (at least V30), random reading and writing (A2). But that's what a card is for now, and most of the other devices, like Switch, don't meet the total speed of their SD card design, ** so it's just A1, or A2. **

## Parameters match?

> ** Capability Card no longer seems normal**
>
> In the past, low-cost large-capacity storage cards were often condensed, but such cards were not available to even the strawberry pie starter, as they contained a mirror verification program. If the nominal capacity is not matched in practice, the mirror writing cannot be completed. So, there's no need to think about that for the berry pie. It's already very cheap to store particles, and it's not usually done again. This problem does not generally exist if the capacity is not very excessive (>128G).

How do you test the memory card and the hard drive?

We can view S.M.A.R.T. information and basic parameters of the hard drive with `Crystal DiskInfo ' . The `CrystaldiskMark ' can also be used to test the reading and writing of hard drives and storage cards (use USB 3.0 readers!)

These two softwares were developed with the developers, but their [official website] (https://crystalmark.info/en/) do not know why many false advertisements were placed to induce the downloading of wrong documents.

Download Crystal DiskInfo from ** [here] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/crystaldiskinfo)**; download from ** [here] (https://sourceforge.net/projects/crystaldiskmark/files/**);

And ** don't** visit his website because it's the place where the files are finally stored, and you'll end up here.

At the time of writing, the author had downloaded `Crystal DiskInfo9_3_2Shizuku.exe ' and `Crystal Disk Mark8_0_5 Shizuku.exe ' . Because it's good, you can replace "Crystal DiskInfo9_3_2.exe" with "Crystal Disk Mark8_0_5.exe" if you do not need a fancy color.

! [Reksa 1066 x A2 U3 128GB memory card reading and writing rate] (..gitbook/assets/lksd1.png)

It is clear that the physical test of the Rexa 1066x A2 U3 128GB memory card does not correspond to the page label: it should be read A2, 4000 IOPS, written 2000 IOPS. In fact, only half of them are randomly read and written; continuous reading and writing is even more absurd. Why?

# # Any microSD memory card exceeding 104MB/s is meaningless

Why? On the one hand, because it is not used as an ultra-frequency reader (i.e., a Rexa-attached reader to support its own defined protocol), because the UHS-I protocol speed limit is 104 MB/s (SDR 104), any storage card is theoretically impossible to exceed, except with UHS-II (two sets of gold fingers), but for microSD it is almost non-UHS-II and only standard-sized SD cards (a camera). So, as long as the speed exceeds the UHS-I velocity limit and is not UHS-II in the market, the non-standard agreement must have been used. ** This non-standard agreement can only be supported by their official card readers (sale at very high prices and generally tied sales). Other equipment does not support this rate and is therefore meaningless. **
