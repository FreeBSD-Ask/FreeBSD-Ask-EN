# Foreword: the Cape of Good Hope and the Tower

FreeBSD is an open source UNIX operating system that is directly inherited from BSD UNIX. It's widely used in apple products, QNX systems, navigating networks, etc。

Since September 2002, there has been no more primer and basic course for FreeBSD in the Chinese language. On the Internet, there are only 10 high-profile papers on FreeBSD, all of which are master's papers, while Linux has over 20,000 and over 100 doctoral thesis. FreeBSD-related jobs are also not available on the national recruitment website and schools do not offer courses. Looks like the market doesn't need any more, does it

Where are the people who promoted FreeBSD? Will there be occasional visits to <https://freebsd.org>? "How many people have admired your youthful face / know who wants to endure the cruel change of time / How many have come in your life and know that I am with you all my life"? It is only your friend who is with you who is forgotten, first and later。

The world is large, but for most people, poverty will not reach the corner of Africa for life. With the limitations of the Mercator projection, one cannot see how vast Africa is. It is felt that Russia is large and Greenland is larger. In fact, together, even China is well below two thirds of Africa. The world is so big, just like the open-source world; in the face of an empty sky, do people choose to keep up their heads and fall into the mud, or do they lower their heads to fill themselves up with their busy work? Some people may have lived in villages for their entire lives and have never gone further, but this does not prevent people from understanding their deep world of thought. Even if people were completely incapable of reading him, they would remember him every year. The world is indeed large and too big to reach for life. The world is so small, it's too small to come back and forth every day. Where the hell is our corner? The larger the world, the smaller it is。

FreeBS has been exposed for more than seven years now. I never made any direct contribution to the FreeBSD project, and I didn't submit any code to ___CODESPAN_0_. But I've done my best to continue my self-preservation。

THIS SERIES OF COURSES AND ARTICLES IS PRESENTED AS AN OPEN-SOURCE BOOK, ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE I HOPE IT WILL BE USED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT AND WITH THE BROADEST POSSIBLE BENEFIT, LIKE THE BSD。

According to the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, there is a pre-existing nature (see " Existenceism is a humanitarianism " ); there is no fixed nature of human existence, and the essence of human beings is built in practice. It is clear that most people now feel the same way that people have to make sense to get meaning at the same time. It seems to be the ultimate answer to the question of meaning. So, is it true? Early on, Sartre considered that human freedom was absolutely unlimited and did not recognize any so-called objective restrictions. I can do it, but I haven't done it, because I'm finding the meaning of doing it。

NOW IT COMES TO MIND THAT LIU XIEYUN HAS A CHARACTER CALLED “JEAN AT THE TOP OF THE 10,000”, WHICH TRAVELS FROM ITALY TO CHINA TO PREACH, AND WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND TO BE AN ONION-SELLER, AND ONE OF THEM, “WANG”, WHO OFTEN WANDERS AROUND WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. IN THIS WORLD, APART FROM CONSOLING OURSELVES, WHICH IS PROBABLY THE BEST OF THE WORLD, AND WHICH IS THE EXPRESSION OF GOD ' S ALMIGHTY WILL, WHAT EXCUSE IS THERE FOR SAYING THAT THE WORLD IS GOOD? I WALK AWAY, I DON'T KNOW ANYONE. JUST LIKE WATCHING VR MOVIES. COULD THE WORLD BE A MOVIE? WHAT DIFFERENCE DO WE MAKE, APART FROM BEING A COLLECTION OF SELF-PERCEPTIONS? I WASN'T THERE IN A VIDEO SHOW. THE WALLS OF THIS KINDERGARTEN ARE ROUGH, THEY LOOK YELLOW, AND THEY HIT HARD. BUT IT'S NOT ALL THERE IS. IT'S WORKERS. BUT IT'S NOT IN CONFLICT WITH ALL THIS BEING A MOVIE. THINK ABOUT IT, WHO MADE ME SEE THE FENCE? WHO MADE ME TOUCH THE PILLAR. IS THERE REALLY NO ONE? IS THERE A REASON? AM I FREE NOT TO TOUCH? DO I REALLY HAVE THE FREEDOM NOT TO TOUCH THIS HARD YELLOW POST? WHY AM I STILL HERE

I HAVE NOTHING BUT DISEASE. IS LIFE REAL? AS CAMOU SAID, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN OUTSIDER. I USED TO COMFORT MYSELF WITH THE WORD “GRATEFUL AS WATER” IN THE BANK OF YAMAGI. I WENT TO THE WHOLESALE MARKET FOR BOOKS MORE THAN A DECADE AGO, AND IT'S STILL THERE AND IT'S GONE, AND I CAN'T FIND ANY OTHER BOOK THAN A TEACHING AID; THE MAN WHO READ WITH ME WAS THERE AND HE WAS NOT THERE, AND I CAN'T TALK TO HIM ANYMORE. MAYBE THEY NEVER EXISTED, JUST A MOVIE I SAW. AFTER THE MOVIE, THE GROUP SHOULD BE DISBANDED. I WAS STILL FIGHTING " THREE KILLS " , AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO THREW THE IRON BOX, AND THE THREE WERE KILLED IN PLASTIC. I FINALLY WON. I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE SO MANY HAPPY DAYS, BUT THAT WAS THE END. I CAN'T FIND ANYONE ELSE TO KILL THREE COUNTRIES. ON OR OFFLINE. EVEN 2V2 CAN'T FIND ANYONE. THERE WILL BE NO LAND, AND THERE WILL BE NO MORE FEASTS, AND THE LANGTING IS OVER, AND THE RUINS WILL BE COVERED. I HAVEN'T KILLED THREE COUNTRIES IN A LONG TIME。

I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO TO THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE BSD IN MY LIFE, EVEN TO SEE IT. I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE DOCTORATE IN PHILOSOPHY THAT THEY HAVE ASKED FOR. WHERE IS MY HORN OF GOOD HOPE? DOES IT REALLY EXIST? NOW I CAN'T LOOK UP, EXCEPT FOR A FOG. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE MOON, AND IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A RADIANT LAMP FOR THE TOWER。

Existence is broken. Anything good, just a bunch of crap. A lot of good things go away, even with a mind to promote. Sooner or later, all open-source projects will become digital graves, which will leave them untouched。

The truth is that every day it is missed by countless people. The North Island poem says, "All relationships are first-time. " Even know people. I don't mean people are dead. It's like a group of friends, he doesn't talk, he's dead, no difference, you bring him back to talk, no point. First you don't want to do this, second he doesn't want to. Isn't it a few years since everyone was together? In practical terms, talking is dead. Only those who speak are living for themselves. It has nothing to do with the physical health of this person. The dead are everywhere. Haven't we lived on the graveyard? They'll disappear, they're gone, they're gone, they're dead. He unloaded all the chatware you used, and even if you licked it, it wouldn't help. Sooner or later, all the chat groups become digital graves. It doesn't make sense. Realism and herds are bullshit. Nothing is left behind, and so is reality. The screenshot is not a picture of Saber, no difference. Is the world big? Why does it feel so small? It doesn't make sense, either a group or reality is a bluff. You don't even know the longest person you've ever been in, and you don't want to. Who wants to make friends with their colleagues? I don't remember. Everyone's busy, and the world should be so beautiful. The truth is, they've just changed a place to brag. It's a comfort to be full. Are those who didn't walk with us, real? Do I have images of them

I've always been an outsider. Never participated in any FreeBSD development and maintenance. For the FreeBSD project, I'm like Yuko Namyang, and I can't find a peach flower anymore. Why didn't I come? I can do it, but I haven't done it, because I'm finding the meaning of doing it. I did, and I never did。

This is an era of great currents. Industrialization and modern science require that everything be measured by standards, efficiency and currency. All that is rash is formalism, all that is long is nonsense, all that looks ahead is cowardice, and all that is not mathematical is nonsense. Modernity never existed. Can you find any so-called civilization on the worm? Humanity has always been ignorant and backward, but it has often covered all this with formalism and modern science. Can human civilization never end? I told you, I don't believe you

Rose Threes roses: “I wish that I envy my merciless wind, I wish that I love my plethora of tourists, and I hope that the red face will never fade.” The roses are eventually turned into dirt. Can I really find a rose that rots under the bar? If it exists, where is she

I've been thinking. No one is going with me anymore. I have no friends. My friend, what I did to him, what he did to me。

THE CHINESE COMMUNITY IS NO LONGER DIFFERENT FROM OTHER GROUPS. EVEN BEFORE. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS TO LOOK AT THE OTHER GROUP OF NEARLY 100 TRANSLATORS WITHOUT A SINGLE TRANSLATOR? THE BSD DISCUSSION IS NOT EVEN A BASIC BSD. THERE'S NO POINT。

I was exposed to FreeBSD in 2018. In the same year, I went to the hospital for serious bodily symptoms and said I was severely depressed. So the first few years of bragging in the crowd, because there's nothing to move, and so are the fingers. There's a man in the group who says why don't we put the curriculum together. I said, do you name the server money? He bought a domain name -- CODESPAN_0 -- for server vercel. I got 20 or 30 in one night -- because I couldn't sleep at night. Still in pain. Two years later, a new hospital was opened. It's gone. However, it is often felt that the world is broken. Everything feels meaningless. It took me years to learn some Western philosophy, and it took me years to learn some Western philosophy, Christian theology. I haven't been to the hospital in years. In the middle of the runaway book, I broke it for about a year and a half. I am increasingly questioning the truth of the world. Discussion of specific computer knowledge has no meaning, science has no meaning, and science is empirical. Mathematics isn't complete, and it doesn't make sense. Although I've studied in depth before. I've done everything I could to build it. The rest, not I don't want to. I can't. I just spent a couple of hours writing about meaningless things. But that's my only activity in the day. I've never talked about this on the Internet. I'm just saying I'm not well. Every day I feel like I'm not there anymore. But then it didn't make sense, maybe I never existed. I saw the characters in the comics, the bands, the various associations. I always thought they weren't working hard. I knew it would cause trouble, so I never said it. I feel like I have nothing but unhealthy bodies. What I want to do is really hard for me. My 7 open book, now read 15%, in the past, a book was finished in days. If you look at GitHub submit the log. You can see that most of them are submitted late at night, and you can't sleep without taking your medicine. It's useless to say that. I'm just saying that I can make a contribution. Why do normal people not even look at what's ready to say is meaningless? They don't have the right to say no. I feel like I can't get to the day, and I'm still moving myself. I just clicked a few clicks, but that day I basically didn't think of anything else, including eating. I'm copying paste when I think my existence is meaningless。

i said i don't know. i don't have the means to know. it might never happen. everybody says they're working, they're busy, they don't have time to play, they're tired, they don't make money. i'm an outsider, whether it's freebsd or whatever. i know it's my problem, not their fault. i've never complained to anyone. i just copy paste on my own, that's all。

I tried, but I never tried。

HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. I PUT A NOTE BEHIND HIS BACK, AND HE WASN'T MAD AT ME NO MATTER WHAT I DID TO HIM. I THREW THE PAPER IN THE TRASH. HE GAVE ME 5 CENTS, BEGGED ME TO COME HOME WITH HIM ON HIS WAY HOME, ASKED ME TO WAIT FOR HIM — HE WAS ARRESTED BY A GYM TEACHER TO RUN ACROSS THE BARS. ON THE WAY, HE GAVE ME THE CAR PARTS HE FOUND, A FINE STEEL RING. HE SAW ME WANT IT. HE SAID HE FOUND IT ALL THE TIME. HE SAID HIS RENTED HOME WAS TO BE DEMOLISHED TO BUILD A BEER FACTORY. WE'RE GOING BACK TO SHANXI. BACK THEN, POP-YO-YO, HE'S THE BEST. I WON'T DO ANYTHING, LIKE NOW. I SAID I SPENT $5 A BIG DOLLAR BUYING A YO-YO. I'LL SHOW YOU. THE FIRST DAY I FORGOT. THE NEXT DAY, I FORGOT. DAY THREE, OFF. UNTIL NOW, ALMOST 20 YEARS. HIS HOUSE IS STILL IN RUINS. I WENT TO SEE IT YESTERDAY, AND BEFORE, IT REALLY DIDN'T CHANGE. WE NEVER MET AGAIN. HE STILL HASN'T SEEN WHAT I MENTIONED ABOUT YO-YO. WHY DIDN'T I ASK WHERE HIS ACCOUNT WAS, EVEN IF THE NUMBER COULD NEVER BE REACHED, WHY DIDN'T I GO AND SEE WHERE HIS HOUSE WAS? I'M SURE WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, BUT I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HOME MENTIONED THAT DAY. STEEL RINGS DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. LEAVING BSD, I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE I COULD GO. BUT IT'S TIME TO LEAVE. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. I DON'T KNOW WHERE HIS HOUSE IS, I DON'T KNOW IF HE REMEMBERS ME, I DON'T KNOW IF HE THINKS I'M AN OUTSIDER. I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT MYSELF. I NEVER TRIED TO DO ANYTHING. BUT I TRIED。

Buddhism allows for three times more common than the hill. I also gave up FreeBSD three times. Today, there is no further opportunity。

I WROTE A LONG TIME AGO, “WE MUST COME TOGETHER TO DO SOMETHING, BIG AND SMALL, EVEN IF ONLY TO TALK ABOUT OUR LEARNING EXPERIENCE (BUT NOT TO SHOW OFF). OTHERWISE, IF IT IS JUST A RHETORICAL TALK, ARE WE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE GROUPS OR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE JUST BRAGGING, KEY-KNOCKING, BIG-TIMERS? IF THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE, THEN THERE IS NO POINT, THEN I WOULD RATHER THE COMMUNITY NO LONGER EXIST. IF YOU HAVE TIME AND ENERGY, YOU CAN CONSIDER TRANSLATING DOCUMENTS, AND IF YOU HAVE PROGRAMMING, YOU CAN CONSIDER TRANSPLANTING SOFTWARE TO BSD, OR EVEN PARTICIPATING IN SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT IF YOU HAVE HIGHER CAPABILITIES.”

If there is always a place where there is reason, everything new is constantly acquiring reason for its existence, and everything old is constantly losing its necessary reason. Then there's only one thing that doesn't exist at the moment when things are absolutely perfect. So both the new and the old are broken, and it's not rational. That's where it is. The so-called rationality of new things to inherit old things is simply an illusion, because there is no state where the perfect thing exists, and thus the world. It is clear that today, public figures and anything else have no meaning and have been deconstructed by the times. "Mygo!!" In Nagasaki, "I'll do anything if I can," I said. I don't want to see that even the penultimate students can put FreeBSD and KDE5 on VMware Workstec Pro, but there are adults who can't even put the system on a virtual machine in nine months and can't even talk straight about it. Barbados is no longer in place, but people still pretend to be illiterate, unable to read the video, and unable to read the text. Then only God can save them。

People who say nothing and talk about fashionable things every day like that they don't know if they understand or what they don't know. They say a bunch of fakes and people think they do. It's a beautiful new world that markets like these things now. I'm no different than them. After all, how happy is that! If I'm like this, I think I understand myself and say things I don't seem to understand, it's twice as happy! There's nothing more important than happiness in the twenty-first century

It is time to end this ridiculous farce. There's no point, either in the user or the developer group or in myself. There is no way I can force anyone to walk with me and play a role in this great home in the world. It is you who deserve to be with you, and those who talk to you, and do not necessarily speak to you, and those who have not reached the mountains, do not mean that you have never reached the top. Although time is a moving image in the eyes of different people, we are still on the same scene。
