# # suffix expression


WE'VE BEEN USING THE MODE OF CALCULATION EXPRESSION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF OUR EXPOSURE TO MATHEMATICS, THE MEDIUM EXPRESSION. FOR EXAMPLE, TO CALCULATE THE SUM OF 3 AND 4, WRITE __CODESPAN_0, THE OPERATOR (THIS EXAMPLE `+`_) IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NUMBER OF OPERATIONS (I.E. 3 AND 4)。

, AND IN SUFFIX EXPRESSION, THE OPERATOR IS PLACED BEHIND THE NUMBER. __CODESPAN_0_. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN ONE OPERATOR, THE OPERATOR IS PLACED BEHIND THE SECOND NUMBER, SO THE __CODESPAN_1 OF THE GENERAL SUFFIXING METHOD WRITES __CODESPAN_2_ IN THE SUFFIX。

At first glance, suffixing is anti-human, but it is more easily understood by computers and can be used to reduce computer memory access through stacking structures。

IN ONE CASE, THE SUFFIX EXPRESSION __CODESPAN_0 WAS CHANGED TO __CODESPAN_1_. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PROCESS OF ASKING FOR VALUE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, AND THE STACK BAR GIVES AN INTERMEDIATE VALUE FOR TRACKING ALGORITHMS。

| Enter | Operation | Stack | Comment |
| :--: | :------: | :-----: | :------------------------: |
| 5 | Inner | 5 |  |
| One | Inner | Five, one |  |
| Two | Inner | Five, one, two |  |
| + | Add to | Five, three | One, two, get out and get result three in |
| 4 | Inner | Five, three, four |  |
| * | Multiplication Operations | 5, 12 | Three, four out of the cork, let the results 12 go in |
| + | Add to | 17 | Five, twelve out, 17 in |
| 3 | Inner | 17, 3 |  |
| - What | Subtract Operations | 14 | 17, 3 out of the cage, and the result 14 goes in |

WHEN THE CALCULATION IS COMPLETE, THERE IS ONLY ONE OPERATION IN THE STACK, WHICH IS THE RESULT OF THE EXPRESSION ___CODESPAN_0_。

## # dc (Desktop Calculator) desktop calculator

__CODESPAN_0 IS AN OPEN SOURCE CALCULATOR USING SUFFIX EXPRESSION, AND TRADITIONALLY THE __CODESPAN_1计算 CALCULATOR PROGRAM USING SUFFIX EXPRESSION IS PERFORMED ABOVE __CODESPAN_2_。

FOR THE LAST EXAMPLE, WE TRIED TO OPERATE WITH __CODESPAN_0. TERMINAL INPUT

```sh
$ dc -e '5 1 2 + 4 * + 3 - p'

# Linear planning

INSTALL GLPK:

```sh
# pkg install glpk
```

Or..

```sh
# cd /usr/ports/math/glpk/ 
# make install clean
```

IN LINEAR PLANNING, WE OFTEN USE THE SIMPLE METHOD. AT THE COMPUTER LEVEL, THERE'S A LOT OF SOFTWARE THAT CAN FREE OUR BRAINS, AND YOU CAN EVEN GET A GOOD ANSWER IN THE PLAN SOLVER OF THE OFFICE TABLE SOFTWARE. HERE, LET'S BRIEFLY DESCRIBE HOW GLPK IS USED FOR THE FREE COMMAND LINE LINEAR PLANNING PACKAGE. I HOPE YOU CAN REACH OUT TO EACH OTHER。

Let's start with an example from Hamdy A. Tara's book “Operations Research: An Information”, Case 2.4-1:

> There is a bank plan to lend, with a projected maximum of 12 million. The following table shows the relevant data。

| Type of loan | Interest rate | Bad debt rate |
| :------: | :---: | :----: |
| Personal | 0.14 | 0.1 |
| Vehicles | 0.13 | 0.07 |
| Household | 0.12 | 0.03 |
| Agriculture | 0.125 | 0.05 |
| Commercial | 0.1 | 0.02 |

Bad debts mean no profits and no principals can be recovered. In order to compete with other business institutions, the sum of agricultural loans and commercial loans is not less than 40 per cent of all loans; in order to revitalize the real estate industry, individual loans account for not less than 50 per cent of the total, of which individual loans account for no less than 4 per cent; and the bank bad debt rate is allowed up to 4 per cent of all loans。
>
> To solve the way in which banks are allocated the maximum profits。

let's step by step. individual, motor, domestic, agricultural and commercial lending volumes are x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5。

profit = 0.14 + 0.9 x 1 + 0.13 + 0.93 + 0.12 + 0.97 + 0.125 + 0.95 + 0.18 + 5

loss of principal = 0.1 x 1 + 0.07 x 2 + 0.03 x 3 + 0.05 x 4 + 0.02 x 5

target function max z = profit - loss of principal;

Next, the reader can identify the constraints on the subject。

By the target functions and constraints above, we can give the following mathematical models:

```sh
max z = 0.026 x1 + 0.0509 x2 + 0.0864 x3 + 0.06875 x4 + 0.78 x5

s.t. x1 + x2 + x 3 + x 4 + x 5 < = 1200,
x4 + x5 < = 0.4 (x1 + x2 + x 3 + x 4 + x 5),
x3 > = 0.5 (x1 + x2 + x3),
0.1 x 1 + 0.07 x 2 + 0.03 x 3 + 0.05 x 4 + 0.02 x 5 < = 0.04 (x 1 + x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + x 5),
xi > = 0 (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
````

__CODESPAN_0_NEW TEXT FILE (NAMED `example`), ENTER:

```sh
var x1 >= 0;
var x2 >= 0;
var x3 >= 0;
var x4 >= 0;
var x5 >= 0;

maximize z: 0.026*x1 + 0.0509*x2 + 0.0864*x3 + 0.06875*x4 + 0.78*x5;
s.t. C1: x1 + x2 + x 3 + x 4 + x 5 < = 1200;
s.t. C2: x4 + x5 < = 0.4* (x1 + x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + x 5);
s.t. C3: x3 > = 0.5* (x1 + x2 + x3);
s.t. C4: 0.1*x1 + 0.07*x2 + 0.03*x3 + 0.05*x4 + 0.02*x5 < = 0.04* (x1 + x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + x 5);
i don't know;

After saving, terminal input

```sh
$ glpsol -m example -o example.out
```

open **example.out** files:

```sh
$ cat example.out
Problem:    example

The following code is for information purposes only and is available for further information [Official documents] (https://maxima.sourceforge.io/documentation.html)。

```sh
load("simplex")$
maximize_lp(0.026 * x1 + 0.0509 * x2 + 0.0864 * x3 + 0.06875 * x4 + 0.78 * x5,
[x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 <= 1200,
x4 + x5 <= 0.4 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5),
x3 >= 0.5 * (x1 + x2 + x3),
0.1 * x1 + 0.07 * x2 + 0.03 * x3 + 0.05 * x4 + 0.02 * x5 <= 0.04 * (x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)]),
epsilon_lp = 0, nonnegative_lp = true;
```
