[15:52:21]: You need to agree to the EULA in order to run the service. Go to eula.txt for more information.

The suggestion was to agree to the licence agreement by replacing `eula = false ' in `/usr/local/etc/minecraft-server/eula.txt ' with `eula = true ' .

- Run again `$/usr/local/bin/minecraft-server ':

Press **ctrl**+**c** to interrupt. This server is not available at this time for non-official and unlogged users. We need to turn off the formal authentication.

`/usr/local/etc/minecraft-server/server.propertiers ' , replace `online-mode=false ' with `online-mode=true '

- Then run the server again:
