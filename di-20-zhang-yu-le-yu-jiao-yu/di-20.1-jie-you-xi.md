# Renpy Game

`Renpy ' is a visual novel engine that can easily be used to make interactive video games. Since the skeleton of the game is `Python ' language, it can be easily transplanted to different system platforms such as Windows and Linux.

Although the `Renpy ' has not, for the time being, made a systematic fit for `FreeBSD ' , `FreeBSD ' itself made a second package of them. So you can play interactive games on FreeBSD? Obviously not! But we can try a little.


# # Install remple

Use pkg:

```sh '
# Pkg install repy
````

Or use Ports:

```sh '
#cd/usr/ports/games/renpy/
# Make install clean
````

##renpy Set up a Chinese interface

# Play Heartbeat Literature!

>** Warning**
>
It's a horror game, and it's probably [ddlc.moe/warning]!

Here, for example, other games can also operate. Select the decompression of the game with Linux versions (i.e. Windows version, version 2, co-exist).

- Run renpy

The default game path does not recognize the Chinese path in ~/ `, renpy, so the depressure folder `DDLC-1.1.1-pc ' must be placed under the root directory (e.g. `/home/ykla ' ). Chinese Language Package Location: [Doki Doki Literature Club] v1.02 (update) (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=116621672). Let's just unplug it out and put it in the corresponding directory.

On the left side of the engine interface, click " Refresh " . `Projects ' can see the list of `DDLC-1.1.1 ' games to refresh, and when you click on this game, you can load the `Launch Project ' at the bottom right corner.

I've packed up the game for readers at <https://github.com/ykla/DDLC/releases>.

>** Warning**
>
"The Department of Heartbeat Literature!" is a "terror game" (https://ddlc.moe/warning) and is likely to cause depression!

# rpa unpack

- Try to select a game with Linux versions

If the game only supports Windows, the Linux version can be packaged through the renpy engine.

- rpa file unpackage: [unrpa] (https://github.com/Lattyware/unrpa)

Or '$ip install unrpa'

``Python '
$ python3 unrpa-mp "X.rpa"
````

- rpyc file unpackage: [unrpyc] (https://github.com/CensoredUsername/unrpyc)

``Python '
Python3 unrpyc-c "XXX.rpyc"
````

This step is not necessary, but only to facilitate translation into other languages.

# Godot game

Install Godot

```sh '
# pkg install godot-tool godot
````

Or:

```sh '
#cd /usr/ports/devel/godot-tools/ & make install clean
#cd /usr/ports/devel/godot/ & make install clean
````

When you set up a new project, enter the editor, you might find a very high card, CPU. It's because the Godot rendering is CPU in the process, and it's given to a single thread. You need to add a start-up parameter to `godot-tool ':

```sh '
$ godot-tool-rendering-driver openingl3
````

This opens the system monitor for KDE or Gnome and zooms the Godot window into the project Godot editor, and shows that there has been no significant change in CPU occupancy, which means that the rendering has been given to GPU.

In addition to this, it is important to note the creation of the project, if you have a problem with the cartons above, and if you use the mandatory OpenGL parameter, you should choose "compatible" instead of "forward+" or "move" when you create the project, because only "compatible" uses OpenGL3 backends, both of which are RenderingDevice, which can be seen in the introduction to the window.
