# Section 19.1 BSD and philosopher George Berkeley

It is noteworthy that the name of the BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution, Berkeley Software Release) is rooted in the great recent empirical philosopher George Berkeley (George Berkeley, 1685-1753). In his various works, he is generally known as Bishop of Cloyne, or Bishop Beclay。

Whether FreeBSD or BSD, or Berkeley and University of California, Berkeley, his name is his。

Berkeley has different writings in Chinese, as well as aesthetic and English pronunciation (E/ˈbɑkli,ˈbəkli/m/ˈbɚkli/), and only the spelling of “Berkeley” is consistent in English。

The implications of [Because of politics] (https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/george-berkeley-portrait) and translation habits (had been translated into Barclay, etc.) are not only unknown in the Chinese-speaking world, but probably in the English-speaking world。

George Berkeley (1685.3.12-1753.14), 2023 marks 270 years of his death. 2025 is its 340th anniversary。

- 1685.3.12 Born in Kelkeni, Ireland, a gent's family, is the eldest son

- In 1707, he was awarded a master ' s degree in literature at age 22 and stayed in the same year as a special researcher teaching Greek
In 1709, at the age of 24, he was a deacon of the Church of Ireland (to meet the requirements of the College). In the same year, the first book, The New Theory of Visualism, was published
- 1710, 25 years old, a priest at the Church of Ireland. In the same year, Human Knowledge Principles were published, and there have been many discussions about sport

- In 1717, when he was 32 years old, he was appointed Senior Fellow of St. Trinity College, but he chose to leave the college for four years
- In 1721, when he was 36 years old, he was awarded a doctorate in theology, and in the same year (or the following year) he was a priest (Dean) to the head of the Church of Dromor Parish in Ireland; he again chose to stay at St. Trinity College in Dublin, where he taught theology and Hebrew. *De Motu* published that many of Newton's basic ideas were wrong and attacked Newton's absolute view of time and space
- 1723, 37 years old, gained a huge legacy from a friend
- In 1724, when he was 39, he was Dean, the head of the Church of Delhi
- In 1725, when he was 40 years old, he was planning to build a seminary in Bermuda, but he had never been to Bermuda in his life. For the same year, the former post of Head of the Chaplain was given up for fund-raising

- 1739 London Nursing Hospital, where he is actively involved
In 1744, when he was 59 years old, he published Celes: A philosophies of reflection and discussion on the efficacy of tar and other interrelated topics associated with it, in which he advocated pine tar as a gold oil for the treatment of diseases. The book was the most sold before he was born. But it's amazing, and it's been recorded that, like his book sales, he's using this therapy to treat patients with the same remarkable efficacy
- 1752, when he was 67, he gave up the post of Bishop of Cloyn and moved to Oxford
- 1773.1.14 67, accompanied by his wife Anne Foster, who read the Bible, he was resting at Oxford in the arms of God
- 1786, wife Anne Foster died

Note: The Irish Church, the Anglican Communion, is affiliated with the Anglican Communion。

# Beclay paradox and math base

Monsignor Beclay's writings also triggered a philosophical discussion of infinity in mathematics history (i.e. the Beclay paradox, see 1734, Analytics; or a paper to an ungodly mathematician, examining whether the object, principles and conclusions of modern-day analysis are more clearly expressed than religion's myths, beliefs or more obvious reasoning)。

>** Thinking issues**
>
The Beclay paradox has never been resolved。
>
The so-called ε-δ language is defined only to make it agreeable in the ZFC system (e.g. to prove __CODESPAN_0_). Those who believe that paradox does not exist and encourage others to read more of the definition are simply those whose foundation of mathematics is too poor and unwilling to admit that they are ignorant, but who often accuse others of being ignorant, that is, your basic mathematics is too poor. They didn't even take the 17th century, much less the 20th century。
>
Not only are these people very poor in mathematics, but they're even worse in physics. They often use this definition to resolve [Zeno of Elea paradox] (https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/)。
>
IN PURELY MATHEMATICAL TERMS, THESE PEOPLE EVEN THINK THAT CODESPAN_0 IS DEFINED, NOT CONSTRUCTED. EVEN CONSIDERING THAT SYMBOLS SUCH AS CODESPAN_1 — CODESPAN_2 — ARE NOT INHERENTLY VALID IN THE SYSTEM, IS JUST A DEFINITION. THAT IS, EVERYTHING IN MATHEMATICS IS DEFINED, AND IT IS NOT NECESSARY AND CANNOT BE ARGUED。
>
> Question I: Is the idea of transforming mathematics from a purely evolutionary system to a general scientific one, thereby de facto undermining mathematical rigour and objectivity
>
If the discussion on this issue does not involve non-standard analysis and hypernumerics, it must be his/her own mathematical base, not his/her own。
>
Question two: Is there someone ** basic mathematics** too bad to understand definitions; or is there someone ** too bad math base** too bad to be known with their faintness

Beclay and Einstein

Bishop Beclay's approach to school in his form, particularly his opposition to Newton's absolute time horizon, inspired a group of 20th-century scientists, including Einstein, who thought that time was not absolute, but was closely related to the state of the observers' movement, to lead the modern technological revolution in a sense。

>** Skills**
>
Einstein believes in Maherism, while Mah is a Beclayist。

Gradually, philosophers and scientists have come to an alarming conclusion**: Since each object is only the sum of its nature, which exists only in the mind, the entire objective universe of matter and energy, atoms and stars does not exist, apart from being the building blocks of consciousness — a conventional symbol system shaped by human senses。
>
> As Becelle — the mortal enemy of materialism:
> > > "The stars of the heavens and the mountains and trees of the earth, in short, all the entities that make up this great framework of the world, have no substance to leave their hearts... As long as they are not actually felt by me, nor do they exist in my heart, or in any other created soul, they either do not exist at all or only in the heart of a eternal spirit.”
>
Einstein has pushed this logic to the extreme, proving that even space and time are intuitive forms that cannot be separated from consciousness, as we do with the concept of colour, shape or size. Space, apart from being the sort and order of objects in our senses, has no objective certainty; and time cannot be independent of the system we use to measure the sequence of events。
>
The realization that** all of our knowledge of the universe is merely a remnant of impressions that are clouded by our imperfect senses makes the pursuit of reality hopeless. If everything has to be premised on perception, then the world seems to fall apart and become an individual sense of disorder。
>
THERE IS, HOWEVER, A STRANGE ORDER IN OUR SENSES, AS IF THERE WERE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF OBJECTIVE REALITY, AND OUR SENSES TRANSLATE IT. ALTHOUGH NO ONE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT RED OR CENTRAL C, WE CAN STILL PROCEED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT EACH PERSON'S PERCEPTION OF COLOR AND TONE IS ROUGHLY SIMILAR。

# Beclay's idea profile

>Isse est percipi, to be is to be perceived > >

Note**
>
The above-mentioned proposition does not in any way represent Beclay ' s claim to subjectivity or his denial of the existence of objective material. ** These are typical misconceptions。

Reference is made to the principles of human knowledge, which recognize and justify the existence of God. In the Beclay philosophy, the objectivity of material existence does not conflict with the existence of God. The book also responds to misunderstandings and cross-examinations。

This is well understood: there is no objective material that is independent and does not depend on one ' s mind and consciousness (the objective material that we understand must be understood by our mind and consciousness, or otherwise has no meaning), and if there is, it is not known, it is equal to non-existent, and it does not define its existence (and, if it is recognized that the intelligence of the substance is not purely materialistic, it is not much different from the Beclay philosophy). Therefore, we believe that the objective existence of the banal must depend on our perception — that is, existence is being felt. Beyond that, objective existence is unknown and meaningless. Therefore, Beclay believes that the existence of matter depends on the perception of the mind, and that it is inconceivable that there is no material that is being perceived but exists. But it is well known that our world exists (if you deny it here, it is not too different from the Beclay philosophy). So, in order to ensure this, God is inevitable. It is wrong that we always implicitly affirm what has been done in practice as material. If there is a problem with the materiality of the practice itself, how can the presence of non-materiality give the activity a material attribute (on pine glands)? And the materiality of this practicality itself cannot be proved, because human beings cannot understand what exists beyond human perception, unless you rely on God, but that means that you do not have such attributes。


It can be seen that contemporary phenomena are similar to Beclay's philosophy — they all emphasize the importance of direct experience and consciousness。

I'm sorry

- If you think so, because the world exists objectively and is not diverted by human will. Congratulations, you're a Beclay now。

> Question two: Please read Beclay above or further, and explain why。


Beclay also believes that the value of the currency does not depend on the amount of metal in it, but that it is a means of exchange for goods. The value of money comes from credit and social consensus. In his view, income should be distributed evenly among nationals in order to achieve economic equity。

He also advocated economic development through education, training and reliance on the people. In his view, poverty should be improved through large-scale construction。

Beclay advocates that religious groups put aside their disputes and unite for the common good. After he faded away from his vision, he focused on the public good of the local people, whether Catholic or Protestant。

Although his thoughts were not widely shared in the lifetime of Beclay, hundreds of years later, he was very different。
