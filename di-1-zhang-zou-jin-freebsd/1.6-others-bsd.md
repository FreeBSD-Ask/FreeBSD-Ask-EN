# Section 1.6 FreeBSD desktop release


# GhostBSD

GhostBSD started in 2010.

GhostBSD is available at <https://www.gostbsd.org>. Its motto is "A simple, elegant desktop BSD Operation System" or "GhostBSD is a simple and elegant BSD desktop operating system".

GhostBSD was based on TrueOS (an additional lost desktop release), and Gnome was used as the desktop. The GhostBSD name has nothing to do with Ghost, which was previously used in Windows, but is meant to be `(G)home (host)ed by Free (BSD) ' (Gnome desktop driven by FreeBSD), and today the MATE desktop is also a Gnome extension. The GhostBSD default configuration of the Linux Compatible Layer (no idea how to use it). Unlike a normal directory, Choot does not go in, opens deb, rpm doesn't respond), uses the FreeBSD pkg (the default source is the GhostBSD mirror station) and ports, and also has the official graphic software for the GhostBSD's own binary software package.

GhostBSD at <https://www.gostbsd.org/download>. GhostBSD officially provides only installed mirrors based on the MATE desktop, and the community provides XFCE desktops. GhostBSD is a rolling release, but at a slower pace, based on the latest `STABLE ' branch. Common problem documents are available in [FAQ] (https://ghostbsd-documentation-portal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/FAQ.html). You can see that the default does not require a `sudo pkg enstall-g 'GhostBSD*-dev' installation.

GhostBSD requires at least 4GB memory to be installed, as it will run from memory after start-up.

This can be verified from ISO startup, and long waits to copy the file to the memory disk. Start installation:

GhostBSD shell is not compatible with POSIX [fish shell] (https://fishshell.com/).

# NomadBSD

NomadBSD began in 2018. Nomad, a “nomad, frequent migrants”, corresponds to its U-disk-oriented, i.e. plug-in design.

The website of NomadBSD is <https://nomadbsd.org>. NomadBSD is based on FreeBSD 's latest version of `RELEASE ' . A 2G memory can be installed and designed for LiveCD to test the compatibility of FreeBSD hardware.

NomadBSD downloads at <https://nomadbsd.org/download.html> (`MANIFEST ' as pre-packaged software on the right side of the page). NomadBSD defaults to XFCE desktop.

Looks like a self-defined shell.

The input method is problematic.

# MidlightBSD

The website of MidnightBSD is <https://www.midnightbsd.org>. MidnightBSD is also an XFCE-based release. It's hard to name it, and the founder's first cat was Midnight.

Midnight BSD started in 2006. It has its own binary package format - [mports] (https://www.midnightbsd.org/documentation/mports/index.html). Select by default when installing.

MidnightBSD installation interfaces, like FreeBSD, are classic blue and black. Normal user default shell is [mksh] (https://github.com/mirBSD/mksh)

On the first launch, a considerable number of questions were answered: For example, the mirror address is US UK or wherever, privacy collection, hardware information, whether to install a certain particular, or to open a graphical desktop cloud... (You can see `/etc/rc.d/firstboot ' file in its ISO mirror) by default enabled the ipfw firewall.

If graphicization is selected, the installation of `midnightbsd-desktop ' on-site is initiated, and even the use of agents for its downloads is unsatisfactory. The `pkg ' order cannot be used and the alternative order is `mport ' . The change of language by a user rating is invalid.

# Hello System

Hello System began in 2021. Hello System is [Pear OS] of BSD (https://pearos.xyz).

Hello System seems to have stalled for some time. The team did not even register the domain `hello Systems.org ' .

Hello System is available online at <https://hellosystem.github.io/docs>, as well as at their documents website. Downloaded address on [Github] (https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases).

Hello System is designed for Mac users, in short, the desktop Mac-based FreeBSD. Design philosophy is "less and less."

Hello System based on FreeBSD `RELEASE ' version. Default shell is zsh. Installed sudo.

Hello Systems requires 4-8G memory to run. The various designs and interactive logic of HelloSystem are not consistent with the traditional distributions, for example, in terminals where shortcuts **ctrl**+**c** are "replicated" rather than "interrupted" and **CAPS** capital keys are invalid and can only be uppercased by **SHIFT** ... Screen scaling is also problematic and cannot be customised to scale.
