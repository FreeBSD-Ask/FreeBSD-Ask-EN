# Section 1.6 FreeBSD desktop release


# GhostBSD

GhostBSD started in 2010。

GhostBSD is available at <https://www.gostbsd.org>. Its motto is "A simple, elegant desktop BSD Operation System" or "GhostBSD is a simple and elegant BSD desktop operating system"。

GhostBSD was based on TrueOS (an additional lost desktop release), and Gnome was used as the desktop. GhostBSD is a name that has nothing to do with Ghost, which was previously used on Windows, but which means _`(G)nome (host)ed by Free(BSD)` (Gnome desktop driven by FreeBSD), and today the MATE desktop is a Gnome extension. The GhostBSD default configuration of the Linux Compatible Layer (no idea how to use it). Unlike a normal directory, Choot does not go in, opens deb, rpm doesn't react), uses the FreeBSD pkg (the default source is the GhostBSD mirror station) and ports, and also has the official graphic software for the GhostBSD's own binary software package。

GhostBSD at <https://www.gostbsd.org/download>. GhostBSD officially provides only installed mirrors based on the MATE desktop, and the community provides XFCE desktops. GhostBSD is a rolling release but at a slower pace, based on the latest branch __CODESPAN_0_. Common problem documents are available in [FAQ] (https://ghostbsd-documentation-portal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/FAQ.html). You can see that the default does not require CODESPAN_1_to be installed by command。

GhostBSD requires at least 4GB memory to be installed, as it will run from memory after start-up。

THIS CAN BE VERIFIED FROM ISO STARTUP, AND LONG WAITS TO COPY THE FILE TO THE MEMORY DISK. START INSTALLATION:

The ghostBSD shell is not compatible with POSIX (https://fishshell.com/)。

# NomadBSD

NomadBSD began in 2018. Nomad, a “nomad, frequent migrants”, corresponds to its U-disk-oriented, i.e. plug-in design。

The website of NomadBSD is <https://nomadbsd.org>. NomadBSD is based on FreeBSD's latest version __CODESPAN_0_. A 2G memory can be installed and designed for LiveCD to test the compatibility of FreeBSD hardware。

NomadBSD downloads at <https://nomadbsd.org/download.html> (__CODESPAN_0_for preloaded software on the right side of the page). NomadBSD defaults to XFCE desktop。

looks like a self-defined shell。

The input method is problematic。

# MidlightBSD

The website of MidnightBSD is <https://www.midnightbsd.org>. MidnightBSD is also an XFCE-based release. It's hard to name it, and the founder's first cat was Midnight。

Midnight BSD started in 2006. It has its own binary package format - [i'm sorry] (https://www.midnightbsd.org/documentation/mports/index.html). Select by default when installing。

MidnightBSD installation interfaces, like FreeBSD, are classic blue and black. Normal user default shell is [mksh] (https://github.com/mirBSD/mksh)

On the first launch, a considerable number of questions were answered: For example, the mirror address is US UK or something, privacy collection, hardware information, whether to install a certain particular, or to open a graphical desktop cloud... (You can see __CODESPAN_0_file in its ISO mirror) by default the ipfw firewall。

IF GRAPHICIZATION IS SELECTED, CODESPAN_0_ WILL BE INSTALLED ON-SITE, AND EVEN IF THE PROXY IS USED, THE DOWNLOAD SPEED WILL NOT BE SATISFACTORY. THE ___CODESPAN_1_ COMMAND CANNOT BE USED AND THE ALTERNATIVE COMMAND IS __CODESPAN_2_. THE CHANGE OF LANGUAGE BY A USER RATING IS INVALID。

# Hello System

hello System began in 2021. Hello System is [Pear OS] of BSD (https://pearos.xyz)。

hello System seems to have stalled for some time. The team didn't even register the domain __CODESPAN_0。

hello System is available online at <https://hellosystem.github.io/docs>, as well as at their documents website. Downloaded at [Github Up] (https://github.com/helloSystem/ISO/releases)。

hello System is designed for Mac users, in short, the desktop Mac-based FreeBSD. Design philosophy is "less and less."。

hello System based on FreeBSD_CODESPAN_0_. Default shell is zsh. Installed sudo。

hello Systems requires 4-8G memory to run. The various designs and interactive logic of HelloSystem are not consistent with the traditional distributions, for example, in terminals where shortcuts **ctrl**+**c** are "replicated" rather than "interrupted" and **CAPS** capital keys are invalid and can only be uppercased by **SHIFT** ... Screen scaling is also problematic and cannot be customised to scale。
