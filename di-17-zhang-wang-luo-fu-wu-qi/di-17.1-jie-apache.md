apache24-2.4.63:
On install:
To run apace at www.server from startup, add apace24.
In your /etc/rc.conf. Extra options can be found in startup.
# For the Apache WWW server to run automatically on startup, add apace24_enable=yes in /etc/rc.conf file.
# Additional options can be found in the boot script.

Your hostname must be capable of using at least 1 mechanism in
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do that.
Have issues starting depending on the motors you are using.

# Your hostname must be able to resolve through at least one of the mechanisms in /etc/nsswitch.conf, usually DNS or /etc/hosts.
# Otherwise, Apache may have problems at startup, depending on the module you use.

- Abache24 built changed from status MPM to Modular MPM
- More motors are now available per official in the port.
- I'm sorry.
# - apace24 Default build from static MPM to modular MPM.
# - More modules are now enabled by default in the port.
# - Icons and error pages moved from WWWDIR to DATADIR.

If built with motor MPM and no MPM is actually in

# If built using modular MPM and not activated at httpd.conf, mpm_prefork will be activated as default MPM in etc/apache24/modules.d.
# To maintain compatibility with existing PHP/Perl/Python modules!

Please compare the example with httpd.conf.sample
I don't know, I don't know.
# Please compare existing httpd.conf files with httpd.conf.sample files and merge missing modules/commands into httpd.conf files!

On upward:
The default data form was changed from Berkeley DB 5
(deep) from ports to BerkeleyDB 1 from base libc.
# Uptime:

You must build all your data once after
Upgrading from 2.4.62 to 2.4.62_1 or later.
# Upon upgrade, you have to reconstruct all (RewriteMap) databases, especially after upgrading from 2.4.62 to 2.4.62_1 or higher.
