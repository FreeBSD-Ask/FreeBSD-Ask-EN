Section 6.4 Touchboard

FreeBSD supports i2c and USB touchboard by default.

# Turn off the touchboard

Find touchboard:

```sh '
ykla@ykla-mi: $ xinput list
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Vertual core XTEST pointer id=4 [slave pointer (2)]
[slave pointer (2)]
Virtual core keyboard id = 3 [master keyboard (2)]
[slave keyboard (3)]
Windows keyboard id = 7 [slave keyboard (3)]
````

See `6 ' is the touchboard, closed: (final `1 ' is open; `0 ' is closed)

```sh '
ykla
````
