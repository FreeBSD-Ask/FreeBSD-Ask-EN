# Section 7.3 Mihomo (formerly Clash)

Mihomo is available in [ports] (https://www.freshports.org/net/mihomo).

# Install mihomo

- Install with pkg:

```sh '
# pkg install net/mihomo
````

- Or install with Ports:

````
#cd/usr/ports/net/mihomo/
# Make install clean
````

FreeBSD networks are also controlled if they feel trouble can be used in Linux compatibility.


# Unfinished

We need a RC script and a GUI program to represent! If you're gonna invite RP!
