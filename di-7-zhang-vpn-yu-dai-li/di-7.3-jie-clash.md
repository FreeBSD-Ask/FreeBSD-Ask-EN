# Section 7.3 Mihomo (formerly Clash)

mihomo is available in [i don't know] (https://www.freshports.org/net/mihomo)。

# install mihomo

- install with pkg:

```sh
# pkg install net/mihomo
```

- Or install with Ports:

```
# cd /usr/ports/net/mihomo/ 
# make install clean
```

FreeBSD networks are also controlled if they feel trouble can be used in Linux compatibility。
