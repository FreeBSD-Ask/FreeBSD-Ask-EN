# Section 26.4 OpenBSD package manager

Like any other BSD system, OpenBSD software is installed in two main ways: by using an officially pre-compiled binary package, and through ports source code. Here we recommend the first way to install it。

# Binary package

We recommend the installation of software in binary packages, for example in the Fire Fox Browser:

- INSTALL SOFTWARE __CODESPAN_0_
- REMOVE SOFTWARE __CODESPAN_0_
- QUERY SOFTWARE __CODESPAN_0_
- UPGRADE SOFTWARE __CODESPAN_0_
- REMOVE NON-REQUIRED CODESPAN_0_

online query: <https://openports.pl/>

IN ADDITION, THERE ARE GLOBAL ORDERS TO UPGRADE ALL SOFTWARE __CODESPAN_0; DELETE ALL PACKAGE CACHES `pkg_delete -a`_。


# Change source #

Set up a text editor first, because OpenBSD is also by default [nvi] (https://man.openbsd.org/vi)。

```sh
# pkg_add ee # 或者你还可以用 nano，即 pkg_add nano
```

If you cannot/do not want to install ee/ nano or so on, you can modify it using a WinSCP-like software。

Open __CODESPAN_0, replace the default source comment with __CODESPAN_1, i.e. add __CODESPAN_2_. New row with __CODESPAN_3_. Here we choose TUNA Open Source Mirror Station at the University of Tsinghua, and you can choose Ali Baba Open Image Station < https://mirrors.aliyun.com/openbsd>, and Nanjing University open mirror site <https://mirror.nju.edu.cn/OpenBSD>, etc。


# ports


[Query Website]

CVS Online Browse Address: <https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/>

OpenBSD corresponds to multiple system versions (release, stable and current), and between versions ports are not common。

ports in rebase version are not updated, the version number is locked, and to use a scrolled version, use a stable or current system. The upgrade of the system requires the updating or installation of a snapshot version (current) from the source code <https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64/>。

-Release version to direct compression package decompression to `/usr`_, e. g. <https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.5/ports.tar.gz>

- current:

```sh
$ cd /usr
$ cvs -qd anoncvs@anoncvs.jp.openbsd.org:/cvs checkout -P ports
```

- 7.7 stable:

```sh
$ cd /usr
$ cvs -qd anoncvs@anoncvs.jp.openbsd.org:/cvs checkout -rOPENBSD_7_7 -P ports
```

updates ports:

```
$ cvs up -r TAG -Pd
```

# pkgsrc

pkgsrc is the NetBSD package management system, although it claims to support Linux and other BSD systems. pkgsrc appears to have more than OpenBSD official packs in packs, but the only concern is whether pkgsrc fits perfectly with OpenBSD. The following are for interested netizens only to try, and there is no guarantee that there will be no accident, and we do not recommend a pkgsrc-based management system。

```sh
$ cd ~/
$ ftp https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/pkgsrc-2023Q2/pkgsrc.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf pkgsrc.tar.gz
$ cd pkgsrc/bootstrap
$ ./bootstrap --unprivileged
```

Then add the path __CODESPAN_0_ to the path environment variable. The pkgsrc tree is located in ___CODESPAN_1 and all relevant documents for its work are in __CODESPAN_2_。

WE CAN FIND SOFTWARE IN __CODESPAN_0 TO INSTALL THE PROGRAM AND THEN RUN __CODESPAN_1_. IF THE IRC CLIENT IS INSTALLED AT __CODESPAN_2_。
