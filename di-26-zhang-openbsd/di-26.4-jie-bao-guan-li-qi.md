# Section 26.4 OpenBSD package manager

Like any other BSD system, OpenBSD software is installed in two main ways: by using an officially pre-compiled binary package, and through ports source code. Here we recommend the first way to install it.

# Binary package

We recommend the installation of software in binary packages, for example in the Fire Fox Browser:

- Install software `pkg_add firefox '
- Delete software 'pkg_delete firefox '
- Query software `pkg_info-Q firefox '
- Upgrading software `pkg_add-iu firefox '
`pkg_delete-a '

Online query: <https://openports.pl/>

In addition, global orders are to upgrade all software `pkg_add-iu ' ; to delete all package caches `pkg_delete-a ' .


# Change source #

Set up a text editor first, because OpenBSD is also by default [nvi] (https://man.openbsd.org/vi).

```sh '
# pkg_add ee #
````

If you cannot/do not want to install ee/ nano or so on, you can modify it using a WinSCP-like software.

Open `/etc/installurl ' , remove the default source comment - and replace it with `#https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD ' , i.e. add `#'. New line for `https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/OpenBSD/`. Here we choose TUNA Open Source Mirror Station at the University of Tsinghua, and you can choose Ali Baba Open Image Station < https://mirrors.aliyun.com/openbsd>, and Nanjing University open mirror site <https://mirror.nju.edu.cn/OpenBSD>, etc.


# Ports


[Query website] (https://openports.pl/)

CVS Online Browse Address: <https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/>

OpenBSD corresponds to multiple system versions (release, stable and current), and between versions ports are not common.

Ports in rebase version are not updated, the version number is locked, and to use a scrolled version, use a stable or current system. The upgrade of the system requires the updating or installation of a snapshot version (current) from the source code <https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/amd64/>.

-Release version to direct compression package decompression to `/usr ', e. g. <https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.5/ports.tar.gz>

- current:

```sh '
$cd /usr
US$cvs-qd anoncvs@anoncvs.jp.openbsd.org:/cvscheckout-Pports
````

- 7.7 stable:

```sh '
$cd /usr
US$cvs-qd anoncvs@anoncvs.jp.openbsd.org:/cvscheckout-roPENBS_7_7_Pports
````

Updates ports:

````
$ cvs up-r TAG-Pd
````

# pkgsrc

pkgsrc is the NetBSD package management system, although it claims to support Linux and other BSD systems. pkgsrc appears to have more than OpenBSD official packs in packs, but the only concern is whether pkgsrc fits perfectly with OpenBSD. The following are for interested netizens only to try, and there is no guarantee that there will be no accident, and we do not recommend a pkgsrc-based management system.

```sh '
$cd ~/
$ftp https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/pkgsrc-2023Q2/pkgsrc.tar.gz
$tar-xxf pkgsrc.tar.gz
$cd pkgsrc/bootstream
$./bootstream-unprivileged
````

Then add the path ~/pkg/bin ' to the path environment variable. The pkgsrc tree is located in ~/pkgsrc/` and all relevant documents for its work are in ~/pkg/ ' .

We can install the program in ~/pkgsrc/ ' and then run `bmake install ' . If IRC client `IRSSI ' is installed at ~/pkgsrc/chat/irssi/ `.
