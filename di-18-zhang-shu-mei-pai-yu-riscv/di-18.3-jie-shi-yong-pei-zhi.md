# Section 18.3 Treeberry pie FreeBSD configuration

# SSH Settings

Use XShell to log in to the berries pie. The username is `freebsd ' . root needs to login and enter `su ' with the password `root '.

# Adjustment time zone

```sh '
# tzsetup
````

To select `No ' - > 5 Asia ' - > > 9 China ' - > > 1 Beijing Time > > `Does the adaptation CST' look capable? > > > to choose `Yes ' .


# Time settings

And then there's the time setup, and the raspberry pie 5 used to have no plate on the RTC clock to make sure the time was right. So relying entirely on NTP services to correct time, if the time is not accurate, affects the operation of many services, such as the inability to execute portsnap auto commands.

The method is simple:

Insert `/etc/rc.conf '

```sh '
"YES."
"YES."
"ntpdate_program"
"0.cn.pol.ntp.org"
````

Then turn on the time server:

```sh '
# Service ntpdate start
````

_Other Organiser

```sh '
â™ª date
Tue Aug 1 16:45:55 CST 2023
````

Hostname

In this document `/etc/rc.conf ' , the hostname `hostname= "generic" may also be modified. Change `generic ' to the name he wants.

# CPU frequency

CPU frequency adjustments (600 MHz to 1500 MHz):

```sh '
# Sysrc powered #
# Service powered first
````

# Show the temperature

```sh '
@ykla #syscl-a grep map
hw.cpufreq.temperature: 50598
dev.cpu.0.temperature: 51.0C
````

or

```sh '
Root@ykla #sysctl dev.cpu grep temperature
dev.cpu.0.temperature: 50.1C
````

# View CPU Frequency

```sh '
Root@ykla#sysctl dev.cpu.0.freq_levels
dev.cpu.0.freq_levels: 2000/-1 600/-1
````

# htop

- Install with pkg:

```sh '
# pkg install htop
````

- Or install with Ports:

```sh '
#cd/usr/ports/sysutils/htop/
# Make install clean
````

I don't...

Endurance settings (** default F10 saved without `ctrl ' + `c ', Quit to save;** also specified in the file):

```sh '
~/.config/htop/htoprc
````

Write the following to open the CPU frequency, temperature:

```sh '
Show_cpu_frequency=1
=1
````
