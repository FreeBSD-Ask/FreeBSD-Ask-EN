# Section 18.1 Raspberry pie profile and fitting selection

# What's a berries pie?

Our usual Android Android phone, the latest version of Apple MacBook, the TV top box processor are based on the ARM chip.

Berry pie is a board based on an ARM chip, i.e., an interface rich (HDMI, I2C, USB 2.0/3.0, I2S, CSI, GPIO, serial, RTC, PWM fans, DSI, PCIe (required for transfer), POE modules, etc.), which is equivalent to a 1,000-dollar red-metre mobile phone (high-through) for the same period.

A cell phone can do anything, a berries pie can do; a cell phone can do anything, a berries pie can do. It is generally used for embedded development, such as robotics, routers and monitoring.

Berry pies also serve as a tool for infiltration in the American film " The Hacker Corps " (*Mr. Robot*). Of course, the above is not the original purpose of the berry pie, which is a computer-based educational product of the BBF.

I don't...

It is alleged that the original objective of the berry pie was to save the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Cambridge University, which is facing a defunct system. According to the analysis, the main reason for this is that there are no cheap and open computers available to children.

# There is a need to test the 4K reading and writing speed of the U disk/stor card

The test methods are described in other chapters.

The system can be activated from the U-disk without any changes: FreeBSD 12/13/14 was tested to support it, but at a very slow pace: on the one hand, the berry pie was severely constrained by the bus speed and the interface itself was not the highest â€” the berry was sent to berry pie 5 to support SDR 104 (UHS-I). Before that, the old berries gave the highest support to SDR50 (UHS-I). On the other hand, the quality of certain U disks is a matter of concern.

The SD card interface of the berry pie limits the speed of the memory card and is not too high, so there's no experience with the 100MB+ storage card -- And their speed is meaningless and they have to use so-called ultra-frequency readers. In addition, there is no equipment to support the speed they claim.

4K random reading and writing rate is the most important thing for a strawberry pie. The test standard must be at least at [A2 level (reading 4000 IOPS, writing 2000 IOPS)] for the memory card (https://www.kingston.com/cn/blog/personal-storage/microsd-sd-memory-card-naming-conventions).

# The 4K schematic speed of the partial U drive may not be as good as the normal A2 memory card

The most ridiculous is DataTraveler 100 G3 USB 3.0 Flash Drive (DT100G3), and 4K randomly is `0 ' . It's very slow to use.

There's no problem with test data, he's 4K written as zero. It also meets this expected level.
