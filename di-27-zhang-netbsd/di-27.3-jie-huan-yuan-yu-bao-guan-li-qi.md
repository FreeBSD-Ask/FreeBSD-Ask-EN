# Section 27.3 NetBSD Source & Package Manager


NetBSD 's package manager is pkgsrc and supports binary and source code compilation installation. The binary orders are `pkg_* (e.g. `pkg_add ' ) and `pkgin ' respectively.

# Binary Source

NetBSD 10.1 for example:

- Open Source Mirror Station, Nanjing University:

```sh '
#eho https://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/x86_64/10.1/All/ > /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositorys.conf
````

- TUNA.

```sh '
#eho https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/amd64/10.1/All/ /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
````

The source of NetBSD, which requires attention, is confusing, and sometimes a source does not meet the requirements, needs to be replaced by a few more sources, or a direct Google search for “packages +netbsd.org”, such as “kde4 netbsd.org”, which points are provided by domain names such as <https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/curent/pkgsrc/print/libcups/index.html>.

Regular switching between the following sources:

```sh '
#echo http://mirrors.nju.edu.cn/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/x86_ 64/10.0_2024Q4/All/ > /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
````

#pkgsrc compile installation

Similar to FreeBSD:

```sh '
Ykla#cd /usr/pkgsrc/meta-pkgs/kde
Ykla#ls
CVS Makefile applications.mk kf6.mk Plasma6.mk
DESCR Makefile.common kf5.mk Plasma5mk
I'm sorry.

It appears that there are many unfinished projects. But a lot of software depends on it.

```sh '
# mkdir-p/usr/pkgsrc/ # Create directory. It may not exist.
# cd /usr/pkgsrc/ # enter directory
# pkgin install #
#get config -global http.proxy http://192.168.31.77:7890 # set up agent. It won't work.
#get config-global https.proxy http://192.168.31.77:7890 # setup agent. It won't work.
#get line --depth 1 https://github.com/NetBSD/pkgsrc-wipwip #
