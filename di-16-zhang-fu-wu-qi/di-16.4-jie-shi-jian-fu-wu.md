Section 16.4 Time service


# Configure Timezones

- Set the time zone using `bsdconfig '.

- Use command line:

```sh '
#cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai/etc/localtime
````

I don't...

Each user can set its own time zone, setting the `TZ ' variable in the user's shell configuration file.

- Sh, bash, zsh.

```sh '
Export TZ=CST-8
# Or

````

- Csh.

```sh '
Setenv TZ CST-8
# Or
"Asia/Shanghai"
````

- In the Crontab configuration file, set the `Cron_TZ ' variable to read:

```sh '
CRON_TZ=CST-8
* late > ~/date.log
````

- Consider RTC time as local time (compatible Windows time to prevent a difference of 8 hours)

```sh '
# touch /etc/wall_cmos_clock # Create authentication file
♪ Reboot ♪
# sysctl machdep. Wall_cmos_clock #
I'm sorry.
````
