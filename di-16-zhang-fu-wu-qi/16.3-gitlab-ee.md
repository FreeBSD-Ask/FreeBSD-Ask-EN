Section 16.3 Gitlab-EE

# Install Gitlab-EE

```sh '
# pkg install gitlab-ee
````

Or use Ports:

The Port also contains Gitlab CE (community version). To install EE (enterprise version), it must specify `FLAVORS=ee ' :

```sh '
#cd/usr/ports/www/gitlab/
# Make FLAVORS=ee install clean
````

# # See after installation

```sh '
# pkginfo-D guitlab-ee

On install:
Gitlab was effectively involved.
Gitlab has been successfully installed.

You now need to set up the various companies of Gitlab, so please
Follow the instructions in the side at:

https://gitlab.com/mfechner/freebsd-gitlab-docu/blob/master/install/17.8-freebsd.md
# Next you need to configure GitLab components.
# Please refer to the FreeBSD installation guide link above for settings.

On upward from gitlab-ee <11.9.7:
Please make sure you read in UPDATING
# If you upgrade from an old version below 11.9.7,
# Please read the entry in the `UPDATING ' file in FreeBSD reports!

On upward:
If you just incorporated an Major upgrad of Gitlab, for example you
Switched from 17.5.x to 17.6.x, please follow the instructions in the side at:

https://gitlab.com/mfechner/freebsd-gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/17.7-17.8-freebsd.md
# If you upgrade the main version (e.g. from 17.5 to 17.6.x),
# Please follow the upgraded guidelines above.

If you just incorporated an individual upward of GitLab please follow
I don't know, the instructions in the side at:

https://gitlab.com/mfechner/freebsd-gitlab-docu/blob/master/update/freebsd_pact_versions.md
# If it's just a small upgrade (e.g. from 17.8.1 to 17.8.2),
# See the updated guide for the patches above.

Edit `/usr/local/www/gitlab/config/puma.rb ' and replace `workers 3 ' with the value of the output above, i.e. `workers 16 ' .

## Configure GitLab Database

- Edit `/usr/local/www/gitlab/config/database.yml':

Amend `password: "security password" to `password: "password'.


- GitLab needs write permissions to create a symbol link:
