# FreeBSD Chinese Community Code of Conduct

The FreeBSD Chinese community has been committed to becoming a passionate and respectful community, and we hope that this climate will not change as we grow and develop. To that end, we have established a number of basic rules that we hope will be observed:

:: Friendly patience

:: Warm welcome

:: Considerably

:: Respect for others

:: Be careful with words, be nice to others

:: When opinions are at odds, change of scene。

This is not a list of all prohibitions, but must be guided by their intentions — to help people communicate and participate more easily in the community。

The code of conduct applies to all spaces for the management of the FreeBSD project in the Chinese-speaking community, including online chats, mailing lists, Bug Trackers, FreeBSD activities in the Chinese-language community (e.g., developers ' meetings and social events) and other forums used by the community for communication. It applies to all your communications and behaviour in these spaces, including e-mail, chats, speeches, slides, videos, posters, signs, even the T-shirts you display in these spaces. In addition, in a few cases, a violation of the norm by a person outside these spaces may affect his or her ability to participate, particularly when the act constitutes a manifest violation。

If you believe that a violation of the norms of conduct has been committed, please report the matter to us。

** Friendly and patient. **

** Welcome. ** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports diverse backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, any race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, level of education, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion or lack thereof, and members of mental and physical capacity。

** well thought out. ** Your work will be used by others and you will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues. Remember, we are a global community, so you may not communicate in each other's mother tongue。

** Respect for others. ** We do not always agree, but disagreement does not justify misconduct. We may occasionally feel frustrated, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into physical attacks. It is important to remember that an environment in which community members feel unhappy and threatened is not efficient. Members of the FreeBSD Chinese community should be treated with respect when communicating with other members and outside the community。

** Be careful with words and be nice to others. ** Do not insult and demean other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary practices are unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

:: Threats and language of violence against others。

:: Discriminatory jokes and language。

:: Publication of pornographic and violent materials。

Publication (or threat) of personal identity information (“human search”)。

:: Individual insults, in particular the use of racial and gender-based terminology。

:: Unwelcome sexual content。

:: To promote and encourage any of the above-mentioned acts。

* ** In general, if you are invited to finish, please close. ** The continuation of such acts after being requested to cease is considered harassment。

* ** In case of disagreement, try to think differently. ** Social and technical differences often arise, including in the FreeBSD Chinese community. It is important that we resolve differences and differences in a constructive manner. Remember, we're different. The power of the FreeBSD Chinese community comes from its diverse communities and from people of all backgrounds. Different people have different views on the issue. Failure to understand why someone holds a certain view does not mean that they are wrong. Let us not forget that man is not a saint, and that no one can be wrong and no one can blame one another. Instead, it focuses on helping to solve problems and learning from mistakes。
