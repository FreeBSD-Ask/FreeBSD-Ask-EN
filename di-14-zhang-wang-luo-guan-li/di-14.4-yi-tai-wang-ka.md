# SECTION 14.4 USB NET & ETHERNET

Ethernet card

# Realtek

# Realtek RTL 8125 2.5 G

The common 2.5 G net card is this, the crab card. You can view it in the Windows device manager. The following example is the card:

[Realtek RTL 8125 2.5 G] (..gitbook/assets/rtl8125.png)

>** Skills**
>
>RTL8125 Default under FreeBSD is not driven and needs manual installation. The simplest option would be to use a mobile phone USB shared network to access the Internet on a temporary basis, for the rest of the manual. A webcard is installed to restart it。

The same method of installation。

Install Method

:: Install with Ports:

```sh
# cd /usr/ports/net/realtek-re-kmod/ 
# make install clean
```

Note**
>
> WHEN COMPILING THE INSTALLATION, A SOURCE CODE IS REQUIRED AT __CODESPAN_0_。

:: installation with pkg:

```
pkg install realtek-re-kmod
```

---|---

Configure:

```sh
# ee /boot/loader.conf # 写入以下两行
if_re_load="YES"
if_re_name="/boot/modules/if_re.ko"
```

By default, a giant frame has been opened and is to be closed (affecting the speed of the net, if it is too slow to close):

```sh
# echo hw.re.max_rx_mbuf_sz="2048" >> /boot/loader.conf
```

TO ENABLE WOL AWAKENING:

```sh
# echo hw.re.s5wol="1"  >> /boot/loader.conf
# echo hw.re.s0_magic_packet="1"  >> /boot/loader.conf
```

All of the above-mentioned settings need to be restarted。

# Intel card

## 2.5 G

Intel i225-V, i226-V 2.5G netcards are default-driven and do not need configuration. Tested (I226-V rev04). Driven by __CODESPAN_0_. The card is displayed as __CODESPAN_1_style。

Support list:

:: I225-LM (COMMERCIAL END PRODUCT LINE, SERVER)
:: I225-V (DESKTOP END PRODUCT LINE, COMMON IN HOME DESKTOPS)
:: I225-IT
:: I225-K

** FreeBSD probably does not support __CODESPAN_0 and __CODESPAN_1 _1 — for example, “Dorewin steady” — if you simply click on the chip group to buy the card. In this case, the developer should be contacted to write your hardware to drive and then recompile the kernel. **
