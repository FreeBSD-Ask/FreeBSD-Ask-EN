Ethernet card

# Realtek

# Realtek RTL 8125 2.5 G

The common 2.5 G net card is this, the crab card. You can view it in the Windows device manager. The following example is the card:

[Realtek RTL 8125 2.5 G] (..gitbook/assets/rtl8125.png)

>** Skills**
>
>RTL8125 Default under FreeBSD is not driven and needs manual installation. The simplest option would be to use a mobile phone USB shared network to access the Internet on a temporary basis, for the rest of the manual. A webcard is installed to restart it.

The same method of installation.

Install Method

:: Install with Ports:

```sh '
#cd/usr/ports/net/realtek-re-kmod/
# Make install clean
````

Note**
>
> At the time of installation, a source code is required at `/usr/src'.

:: Installation with pkg:

````
Pkg install realtek-re-kmod
````

I don't...

Configure:

```sh '
#ee /boot/loader.conf # writes the following two lines
If_re_load=YES
If_re_name="/boot/modules/if_re.ko"
````

By default, a giant frame has been opened and is to be closed (affecting the speed of the net, if it is too slow to close):

```sh '
#echo hw.re.max_rx_mbuf_sz=2048>/boot/loader.conf
````

To enable WOL awakening:

```sh '
# echo hw.re.s5wol= "1">/boot/loader.conf
# echo hw.re.s0_magic_packet="1">/boot/loader.conf
````

All of the above-mentioned settings need to be restarted.

# Intel card

## 2.5 G

Intel i225-V, i226-V 2.5G netcards are default-driven and do not need configuration. Tested (I226-V rev04). Driven by `igc '. The card is displayed as `igc0 ' style.

Support list:

:: I225-LM (commercial end product line, server)
:: I225-V (desktop end product line, common in home desktops)
:: I225-IT
:: I225-K

# # Gg and Gg and other Ethernet cards

i210, i211 driven by em. The default should be driven, not configured, but untested.

# USB webcard recommendation

> ** Warning**
>
> gigabytes and 2.5G webcards ** Previously, there had been intermittent failures at 15.0 CURRENT. ** Please contact us if you have a better recommendation.
>
> For 2.5G USB webcards, only RTL 8156 and RTL 8156B appear to be available.

** Ax88179A and RTL8156B have been tested on berry pie 5 and can continue to work for more than 72 hours. **

** FreeBSD probably does not support its `VendorID' and `ProdutID' — e.g., “Dorewin secure” if it simply uses a chip set to buy a web card. In this case, the developer should be contacted to write your hardware to drive and then recompile the kernel. **>Bug:
